6,The Shape of Games to Come,"On August 11, 1989 something wonderful happened in my life. No, I didn't finish a hot new game or blow away an old high score, this day was much more special than that. It was in the early hours of that Friday morning that I witnessed the birth of my first son, Steven Shea. Needless to say, little Steven wasn't exactly thrilled with being in his new world those first few minutes, but both his dad (who went through a couple of pairs of Reeboks during the 22 hour wait in the delivery room) and his mom (who went through a couple of nurses during those same 22 hours) were quite relieved.

Since that day Steven doesn't feel quite as bad about his new home. In fact, he's adjusted quite well and, except for that occasional all-nighter, is really a perfect kid. During one of those 3 A.M. feedings and walks (you can guess who does all the walking), however, I looked at the little guy and started wondering what kind of games he'll be playing when he gets a little older.

We've seen giant leaps and bounds in video game technology unfold before us within just a few years. When you think that only ten years ago the Atari 2600 was state-of-the-art, you begin to really appreciate just how far this hobby has come. The Turbo and Genesis are hot today, but what will tomorrow hold? Holographic games?

Even the Nintendo, which still has the ability to play great games, is starting to look a little rough around the edges when played next to the two aforementioned 16-Bitters. Will they be able to replace the Nintendo? Probably not, but both the Turbo and Genesis will ultimately carve out a slice of the video game pie that Nintendo has been able to control completely in the past. To top it off, the current crop of next generation game systems are just the beginning. If the corporate cards are played right these consoles will be joined by even more advanced or newer systems like the Konix Multi-System, NEC Super Grafx, or Nintendo Super Famicom. The evolution of these systems may prohibit one from getting a foothold and dethroning Nin-tendo, but along the way just think of the machines that will be produced! Tomorrow's games will be limited only by the imagination!

As I looked down and saw that Steven had drifted away to sleep, I thought out loud, Don't worry Steven, no matter what games you play later in life, you're gonna have a blast!

8,More Than Good Looks,"Recently, the staff of EGM got together to assess where we've been and where we're going. Besides talking between ourselves, we also sorted through hundreds of letters that had been sent by you, our faithful supporters and readers, to determine exactly what's good and bad between the covers of this magazine.

Thankfully, most of the responses that have appeared in recent months have given us glowing ratings. You especially seem to appreciate our multi-review-ing system and the constant flow of information that appears in these pages. The common request for more info on more games and game systems, however, remained constant through most of your letters.

While we fully intend to meet your demands for fresh softs on a regular basis (you'll notice that a revamped version of our NEXT WAVE preview section has returned with this issue), one question that we've asked ourselves in recent months was how to properly show off the games that you'll one day play.

Then we realized that the answer to this question was contained in the question itself! Instead of using columns of text or filling pages with unnecessary box art and illustrations, we decided to show the games inside and out with literally hundreds of photos that would give you an immediate impression of what the game was all about. Why talk about the super Bosses in Truxton when we can show you exactly what they look like!

We've expanded on this approach by concentrating our efforts almost entirely on the games themselves. The staff of EGM lives and breaths games just like you do, so it's much easier to determine what other game players will like since we're fanatics ourselves! Your letters confirmed our beliefs by stating that you'd rather see some sharp pictures of a new title and not the front door of the corporation that created it.

Of course there are magazines out there for you players that buy a game to look at the box artwork. But if you're hot on wild graphics and great game play, then you've come to the right place when you open the cover of EGM. We're the only stop you need to make each month if you want to see all your upcoming favorites inside and out!

9,The First Word on Video Games,"One of the most frequent questions we receive from industry insiders and readers alike concerns our ability to track down new information and provide a complete story on all the latest video game hardware and new games. As veteran readers know, EGM was the first magazine to break the story on Nintendo's upcoming 16-Bit Super Famicom, the NEC Super Grafx, Konix's Multi-System, the Nintendo hand-held GameBoy, the color Lynx, and the Japanese Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 to name but a few. Over the months EGM also brought the first newsstand photos of games such as Gradius 2, Batman, Phantasy Star 2, and many, many more.

How do we do it? Well, it's not easy! Our staff maintains a constant relationship with dozens of contacts around the world. Not only do we trade news and information with the leading magazines of Europe and Japan, we also stay in touch with top executives at some of the leading manufacturers and development houses throughout the same countries. Over the past six months EGM ambassadors have traveled to Japan and Europe a number of times to visit important trade shows and meet privately with some of the leading video game super-powers.

Why do we go to so much trouble just to get a story? Because, as game players, we know that the most important role a video game magazine can play is in providing new information. Whether it's honest reviews with an opinion, previews of upcoming softs, or the latest developments from over-seas, EGM is the magazine that will be their first - with all the facts.

Sometimes other stumbling blocks will make it difficult to bring you info through normal channels. Some companies unjustly award private exclusives to competing publications, unfairly penalizing game players like you if you don't read a particular gaming magazine. We never demand exclusives because EGM feels it is your right to know as much as you want about all the new products on the horizon. For a company to hold a private showing of a new hand-held or provide an exclusive and thereby lock out your desire to know the complete story, good or bad, is just plain wrong.

That's why we're introducing a new column in this issue of EGM! Electronic Gaming Express is your ticket to the latest developments in the world of video games. This issue we continue our edge on the forefront of technology with the total coverage and the first photos of the new Nintendo Express hand-held, NEC hand-held, and new info on the Sega 8-Bit hand-held. You'll also find the first news and pictures of SNK's new video game console, the NEO GEO! This is hard-hitting editorial you won't find anywhere else!

Combined with our regular International Outlook and Next Wave features, you've got the best ticket to the ever-changing video game world right in your hands!

10,Video Games in the 1990s,"Welcome to the biggest and best issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly ever! Beginning with this edition we plan to not only provide you with the most up-to-date info on new games, tips and developments from within the industry, but we've also increased the total number of pages to supply you with adequate coverage of all the latest systems and game softs that will appear in the months to come.

During the last year we've seen an explosive growth in Nintendo market, with dozens of licensees releasing hundreds of cartridges compatible with the king of the video game hill. We've also witnessed all-new categories opening up in the portable and 16-Bit areas, with an explosive growth resulting in a new level of player satisfaction.

But are video games a fad? Not hardly, considering the fact that more NES carts are expected than ever before, with several titles such as Ninja GaiDen 2, Super C and Metal Gear 2 likely to draw even more attention to the tried and true 8-Bit workhorse. When you couple that continued interest with the rumors of new hand-held systems that play existing NES, Sega and Turbo games, you can bet that the systems of today will remain popular well into the future.

Even though 16-Bit systems such as the Genesis are commanding a high profile from players, don't think that other companies aren't looking for new avenues to explore for greater types of gaming! Remember that Nintendo still has a super system surprise of some kind (see Quartermann for new info on a possible new Nintendo mega-machine), and new rumors of a Sony 16-Bit, NEC 32-Bit, and NES-compatible CD-ROM interface continue to fuel the next generation fires. But how long will it be before games peak in potential?

Probably never. But in the face of all of these changes and with the introduction of additional hardware systems expected throughout this year and next, you can count on one source to have the first word on all the gaming developments that will affect you! Electronic Gaming Monthly has expanded its size and scope to include these changes with even more multi-per-son reviews, all-new previews you won't find anywhere else, and supplements and inserts that highlight specific systems and games!

In this issue you can read about several new hardware developments like a new Power Glove and graphics chips that let the NES make games that look like the 16-Bitters! Combined with hot tips and tricks, loads of honest reviews, a Phantasy Star 2 pull-out, Super Mario Bros. 3 supplement, and all of the regular EGM features, you've got much more than a normal video game magazine in your hands. We hope that you enjoy the additions we've made!

11,Striving to Be The Best,"Welcome once again to Electronic Gaming Monthly, your one-stop source for the complete picture on video games! No matter what systems you own, or what type of games you enjoy to play, EGM covers it all!

As we continue to publish EGM, we are constantly looking for ways to make your magazine better. A lot of the guidance we get comes from you, our loyal readers, the ones who make all of the hours at the keyboard worthwhile. We've listened to what you've said in the past and that's helped us shape EGM into the magazine you now hold.

That's not to say that we've stopped evolving. In fact, regular readers will notice a big change in this issue of EGM. No, we haven't dropped any of the regular columns - we simply made them look a whole lot nicer! Beginning with this issue, we're employing a new computer system that will allow us to bring even more color and photos to the pages of the magazine. Combined with our editorial philosophy, we think that the addition of vivid visuals will improve the quality of EGM throughout.

Unlike other mags, however, which rely heavily on one aspect of production or the other, we want to make EGM a well balanced collection of good looks mixed with breaking news, exclusive previews, helpful tricks and no-holds-barred reviews.

EGM has consistently delivered the scoop on new systems, games and innovations and this edition is no exception. Turn to page 24 and you'll get a sneak peek at a number of new games that have been released in Japan and may soon end up on store shelves in the States! Some of these great new games that you'll see for the first time include Phantasy Star 3 and Final Blow for the Japanese Genesis, as well as a new soft for the NEC Super Grafx (which up until now has been sorefully dry on games). Flip the pages and you'll get the first pictures to be published of the Nintendo Express hand-held from BDL and the Micro Drive from Sega. You'll also get the complete behind-the-scenes story on how these devices came into being! The Express section also contains some of the most specific info on the Game Genie, Camerica's new super peripheral that may be sold to a major toy company.

Throw in plenty of photo-reviews, the second volume of our Super Mario Bros. 3 Survival Guide and the follow-up to our Phantasy Star 2 Power PullOuts and you get yet another explosive EGM packed with info on dozens of

Send us your thoughts through the mail and let us know how we're doing. If you have an idea that you think will make EGM better, by all means please share it with us! Remember, in the end this is your magazine, and since the editors of EGM are all avid game players we have a grip on electronic gaming that you won't find anywhere else - but that doesn't mean we don't want your input!

Now let the games begin

12,The Genesis/Turbo Debate Concludes,"Which is better, the NEC TurboGraf-16 or the Sega Genesis? That was a question we asked four issues ago, and after careful evaluation of both machines and the games they played, we picked our favorite. Picking favorites is always a difficult task for any editor, since one side is perceived as a victor and the other as a loser. This article was no different, and the consequences of our decision went far-beyond normal boundaries.

For supporters of the TurboGrafx, the system that ranked behind the Genesis in terms of play appeal and good game support when the article was written, the reaction was not warmly received. Despite the fact that we stated our position clearly, indicating that great softs can turn any system around, several manufacturers withdrew their advertising and branded EGM as anti-TurboGrafx.

We originally decided to run these articles because hundreds of readers had requested our opinions as game players. EGM, unlike other gaming mags, is written for the end-user, not the game companies. As game players ourselves, we pride ourselves on featuring info and softs that will be appealing to other gamers like you. Although it has been controversial in the past, we feel that it is more important to give games appropriate ratings instead of labeling every cart a hit! Being honest to you will not only enable you to get a better bang for your buck, but it will also let manufacturers get a better understanding of what game concepts are stronger than others.

Most game manufacturers have been able to appreciate the important role that EGM plays to today's game playing public. NEC in particular, a company which found itself trailing in the comparison, has continued to support EGM with both editorial and advertising support, recognizing that, despite the feelings of others, that EGM will remain be behind the Turbo system and do everything possible to promote the games it plays. We showed this initially by allowing you to sound off your opinions, which has proven quite enlightening for all of us. Having an opinion and not comparing games and systems for fear of losing objectivity is a poor excuse for not telling the truth, and EGM readers know that this magazine is here to serve their interests and help them get more out of video gaming. Although it is much harder for us to remain objective in the face of less controversial publications, it is our goal not to waiver from this philosophy.

With dozens of new Turbo games coming from Japan, the NEC system is sure to pick up much more support. With several other hardware units set to debut soon we most certainly we'll re-address the system debate in the future. You can rest assured that no matter what the outcome of such a comparison is, we'll give you a fair game player's opinion and, most of all, tell the truth.

13,The Difference Between First and Last,"We have always prided ourselves in searching out the hottest new developments from within the video game industry. We are equally proud of our ability to print that same information first, before rival gaming mags and often before the companies themselves know!

Recently, however, our competitors have attempted to set the record straight on a number of important gaming topics. While I like to hear information on exciting new products like the Nintendo Super Famicom and Sega Game Gear, many of the references in these articles are so far off-base I feel obliged to comment.

The Super Famicom has been up in the air for months, having undergone a revision in design that has left it more compact. With its new name, the SFX, the 16-Bit Nintendo will be shown to Japanese game players for the first time on November 21, when 300,000 of the machines are reported to go on-sale nationwide.

A topic that one magazine in particular was way-off on is the Sega Game Gear hand-held. While it's true that Sega has no plans to launch such a product in 1990, the machine is absolutely completed, with nearly 20 games nearing readiness. EGM editor Ed Semrad, along with our foreign correspondant Hideki Shikata, has actually played the unit and observed many of its advanced capabilities firsthand. Stating that it's in a prototype stage is erroneous to say the least (see page 30 for the complete story).

If you look at our track record, loyal EGM readers were the first to hear about nearly all of the major twists and turns from within the game industry. Thumbing through past publications, you'll uncover a wealth of info on the following products that was printed in our pages first:

NEC'S PC Engine Sega's Mega Drive
Nintendo's Super Famicom
NEC's Super Grafx
Konix's Multi-System
SNK's Neo-Geo
NEC Turbo Express
Sega Game Gear
Mattel's Turbo Sport Power Glove

To us, it's important to be consistently first with information on games and systems and we constantly travel around the world to get it! We continue our trademark as the First Word on Gaming with this special preview of the games and game system unveiled at the CES show. Traditionally the public birthplace for hundreds of video games and new technology, our editors have documented this event, like all the others listed above, so that our readers will be the first in the know. Check the rest out yourself and see if they even come close to the coverage you get here.

14,Giving the Players What They Want,"If you look at the different gaming mags that currently populate the newsstands, there are two distinct types of publications. The first caters to the manufacturers of the games and hardware, gushing up glowing reviews of anything and everything that makes it to their system slots. They forsake journalistic integrity and honest opinions (if they have an opinion at all) in favor for the bottom-line, which in the case of publications happens to be ads.

The second variety of video game magazine is a much different animal, one consisting of critical editorial, honest appraisals of new game titles and the latest information on the hobby. This type of game magazine exists solely to serve the readers, featuring stories and columns that address every aspect of the industry - from how the games are made to how they are played! Fortunately, EGM resides within this second group of magazines.

Bringing you, the faithful EGM reader, the true facts can be difficult at times, especially when we rely on game companies for support. While a bad multi-review can create tension, most of the manufacturers know when they have a bad game and don't feel slighted when we have four different game players (not writers who think they know how to play games) look at the title separately. Giving the responsibility of a game review to one person can be unfair to game companies and misleading to the readers if that particular individual dislikes the genre of games he is reviewing. The quartet of reviewers we use provides the built-in balance that a real review needs.

Another sore spot for some game companies recently has been the disclosure of game tips and information on prototype systems. These manufacturers have argued that we have no reason to showcase games and game systems from Japan when they may never be released on these shores. With this I totally disagree. Just because Nintendo does not want to lose potential sales on their 8-Bit Entertainment System (a questionable reality in the first place), should that limit our ability to tell you about this next-generation 16-Bitter that Nintendo is working on in Japan? Just as leading car magazines go undercover to find out the look and performance of next year's hot autos, we make it our business to locate, from any and all available sources, the complete scoop on the newest systems, best games and most promising peripherals. Not because it will bother Nintendo or other companies, but because we know, from your hundreds of letters, that it's exactly what you want to read about.

While most game companies accept us for the animal that we are, some have exerted their own form of expression by refusing to advertise with us. One Chicago-based game company, famous for their NES sports titles, singled EGM out when we printed a level select and invincibility to their latest action/adventure cart. Despite the fact that our competitors ran the same tricks, they decided that it was our fault that they had not removed them from the game in the first place and told me indirectly not to count on an ad from them. In the end, it's their loss, not mine or yours.

P.S. Beginning with the next issue, you can look forward to a new EGM!

15,The Hottest Year Ever for Electronic Gaming,"Video games have come a long way in just one year.

Besides witnessing Nintendo cement their role as the leader of the industry and watch the up-and-coming sixteen bit contenders slug it out for the silver and bronze, many other developments have occured that will greatly impact our hobby in the months to come.

First and foremost is the rumor that Nintendo will soon give third-party licensees the right to manufacturer their NES compatible game carts as well as determine the volume of allocation that any one particular game receives. This type of action would undoubtedly open up the doors to a countless number of high-quality games that have been passed over in the U.S. due to special custom chip sets designed by the respective manufacturer in Japan. Konami and Sunsoft are just a few of the many companies that have designed chips to boost the power of the Nintendo 8-Bit. While an announcement from reliable Japanese press sources indicated that Nintendo would soon make such a move, Nintendo personally issued a memo to all licensees telling them, in effect, not to hold their breath. Realistically, however, such an action will most likely take place as production continues to shift to the 16-Bit Super Famicom.

Speaking of the Super Famicom, this 16-Bit mega-monster was recently unveiled to the public at the Nintendo Expo in Japan (see page 28 for our complete coverage of the Super Fami and the games it plays). While the unit is being offered as a dedicated console in Japan, sources close to Nintendo have indicated that the American version of the Super Famicom, set for release in the fall of 1991, will actually be a peripheral that attaches to the underside of the normal NES! This will allow Nintendo to reduce the price of the hardware base, which keeping the aging 8-Bit machine viable in the face of more advanced systems from Sega and NEC.

You can count on both Sega and NEC to remain in the running, however, with special upgrades of their own. The long-awaited Sega Genesis CDROM system will finally be shown next spring, enhancing the audio and play capabilities of the Genesis ever further than they've been pushed before. Sega also has an advanced hand-held system with television capabilities due out in Japan this September and in the states next year. NEC, on the other hand, will attack with their upscale portable, the Turbo Express. A secret company has even developed a hand-held capable of playing the games of ALL systems with minor modifications! A truly remarkable machine.

Yes, 1990 was a great year for gaming. Plenty of games appeared, new systems came into their own, and public interest remains high for a hobby that has no limitations. Looking ahead there are more peaks and valleys waiting, but the brief description of what tomorrow is promising to bring leaves me with high expectations of where electronic gaming will be next year and ten years after that.

The Super Famicom SFX, Game Gear, Genesis CD-ROM, Turbo Express, Lynx 2, Neo-Geo, Konix Multi-System and the hundreds of games they promise to play have me looking to 1991 as the best year yet! I can't wait!

16,Video Gaming Direct From Japan,"We completed a phone survey recently to try and get a grasp on exactly who our readers are and what they like and dislike. As we've said in the past, we put EGM together as game players, for game players, including the information and stories that are exciting and newsworthy (witness this month's cover story on Super Mario Bros. 4). Unlike other mags, EGM hunts for the news behind the games and we spare no expense to guarantee that the info we publish is accurateeven if that means traveling across the waters to Japan or Europe.

To get this month's cover story, we visited the 1990 Nintendo Expo in Tokyo. Much like the Consumer Electronics Show that is held twice a year in the states, this convention gives Japanese Nintendo companies the chance to gather together and put all of their latest titles on display for public and trade exhibition. This year's show wasn't only special due to the unveiling of a variety of great new softs like Double Dragon 3 (see page 28) and Lolo 3 (next issue), it was also the first public introduction of the long-awaited and much heralded Nintendo 16-Bit, Super Famicom. The fact that the machine was even shown is news in itself, considering this magazine has been reporting on its development ever since our second issue back in the summer of 1989, but when you couple the formal debut with over two dozen game carts from a wide source of third-party licensees you have the video game event of the decade!

The Nintendo Super Famicom is being launched with the latest installment of the Super Mario Bros. series, Super Mario World (see pages 42-43). Thanks to the courteous people of Nintendo's parent company in Japan, you can read and see exactly what this game is all aboutexclusive info on a scale that you won't be seeing in any other gaming or non-gaming publication!

With the recent proliferation of direct mail companies that specialize in the importing and sale of Japanese games like Ultimate Game Club, Video Game Excitement, SCI, Game Train, Die-Hard Video, Japan Games and others who advertise in these pages, it has now become possible for the average player to also experience what Japan has to offer. Not only is it possible to buy new game systems like the Sega Mega Drive, NEC PC Engine and Nintendo Famicom, but you can also purchase many games that may never be seen for sale on these shores! With so many new options available to American game players, we feel it is our duty to bring our readers the very best that Japan and Europe have to offer not only in EGM's International Outlook and Next Wave sections, but also in an exciting NEW magazine that will not only let you see what these games are all about, but let you purchase them through selected mail-order houses directly!

17,The Name of the Game,"This month's cover story focuses on an exciting event within the world of electronic gaming - the arrival of the Simpsons' family into the arcades as a pinball game from Data East! This fantastic new flipper game was recently unveiled to the industry during the AMOA exhibition in New Orleans and we were there to get all the news about this great new game from its developers and from Matt Groening, the genius behind The Simpsons appeal!

The Simpsons is not, of course, the first game to enjoy its roots in some other form. While most consumer game companies have long used ties to the arcade industry to capitalize on proven play themes that gamers have already been exposed to, many have begun reaching out to other areas such as movies for the same type of instant recognition that can often help a title stand out from a crowd.

While the process of licensing titles or environments has worked successfully in many instances (witness Batman, Robocop and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), we have to hope that game companies don't compromise their creativity for the sake of a license. Because in the end, no matter how hot the name on the box, it's the game in the box that determines the ultimate appeal and final sales of a soft.

I'm not saying the licenses aren't a good combination for video games. On the contrary, I value the ability that a game has to take me into new directions with characters or situations that I have been attracted to before. There simply needs to be a conscious effort put forth by game developers when a property is secured, to make a game that takes those characters and puts them into a situation that is fun and challenging. For the few that can successfully accomplish this task the rewards will be abundant. But for those companies that rely on the license to sell their game, the future will be bleak indeed.

Nintendo is rumored to be worried of the same thing and has indicated to several licensees that a reliance on movie titles and comic book heroes is not the way to go. I tend to agree. While a hot license can get a cart noticed, the games that consistently reside at the top of the charts are original softs and sequels to these originals. Super Mario Bros., Contra, Mega Man, Castlevania and others are perfect examples of this. A good title is nice for notice, but a good game sells.

When it comes down to the bottom line, the companies that stay close to the industry and put the effort into R&D will ultimately reap the biggest rewards. Every game company will try to wow in some way or another, with big sports stars and film super heroes, but it's the labels with the best games that will win in the end.

18,Is This The End?,"This is not the type of editorial yours truly likes to write. Recently, I was thumbing through some of the publications that serviced the first home gaming revolution nearly a decade ago. Although the games and game machines of the early eighties were prehistoric by today's standards, there was still plenty to talk about, with dozens of third-party softs, no less than half-a-dozen consoles and a wide variety of hand-held units. But despite such fervor, the floor fell out from under the video game industry, leaving game companies to scramble for the false safety of discounts during the last dark days.

What was the root of the problem ten years ago? Did players simply tire of the unrealistic graphics and lack of game play that the Atari machine generated? Or did video games themselves, as a form of entertainment, simply fall out of favor with the game playing public? The answers to these questions need to be addressed sooner than later.

Are things really that bad? Is the video game industry teetering on the brink of oblivion? Is Mario destined to join pals like Pac-Man and the mood ring? Not just yet, but a new element has to be employed by everyone involved in the fantastic hobby we know and love as video gaming: caution.

For all the ill-will directed at Nintendo because of their restrictive business practices and demanding licensing arrangements, they maintained a level of order by limiting the amount of poor product entering the market. I'm not saying that execs at Nintendo were always right. They committed huge blunders when they insisted that licensees focus on the development of Role-Playing Games. Their first big launch in this series, Dragon Warrior, did so well they are now giving them away as a premium. Even with their mistakes, however, Nintendo made sure that only the best new products were introduced in quantities that wouldn't leave retailers overloaded with inventory.

When Nintendo relaxed these restraints they opened up a flood of products that is absolutely staggering. Video game carts are still selling, but with so many choices available to consumers, big hits are few and far between.

So what does this all mean? Some companies, formed to take advantage of the big bucks that video games used to bring, will fall by the wayside and thin out the inventory, making room for more serious players. New systems and labels, may have difficulty finding shelf space from retailers who aren't quite ready to stock up a whole new line of product.

In the end, the final answer to this growing dilemma will be more smarter production from game companies to avoid overproduction and the mark-downs that follow (bringing with them the financial hurt to all levels of the industry), smarter purchasing from toy stores and retailers to locate only those titles that show real promise and a real plan to pull non-selling games out of the stores to make way for new carts on a regular basis. It works in Japan, why not here?

19,The Shape of Things to Come,"The title of this semi-annual self-appraisal of the state of the video game industry and what its future holds for game players everywhere is fairly self-explanatory, but may need a bit of clarification following last month's dim assessment of the direction we seem to be going.

While the theme of last month's editorial was one of caution, the one point that can never be denied is the relentless need for constant evolution to insure an ever-changing and ever-challenging product mix is available at both the software and hardware levels. True, this does make the job of the manufacturers that much harder (as well as that much riskier), but it doesn't mean that the quest for superior gaming is always in vain. On the contrary, there are some really wild products in development that should keep the blood of this industry pumping for some time to come!

The most eagerly anticipated new product of 1991 will surely be the next of the 16-Bit super systems, the Nintendo SFX. With a tentative release date of September, the SFX will hit these shores with no less than two dozen solid game titles in tow, including hot arcade properties from leading third-party producers like Final Fight, Gradius 3, Ghouls and Ghosts 3 and R-Type 2. The packaging of the system is still a mystery (how does Nintendo get the system, power cords, hook-up cables and pack in game together for under 200 bucks when it costs that much for just the basic system and two controllers in Japan), but if Nintendo plays their cards right with a Super Mario 4 pack-in, we'll see million-plus sales by the end of next year.

The strength of hand-held systems will level off next year, with the GameBoy continually energized by strong software support that simply isn't much fun to play. Several titles will do well and the rest will sit on store shelves. Game Gear will make a slight impact, but the quality is a step backwards from what Sega fans are now becoming accustomed to on the Genesis. Lynx will enjoy more software that will show off the system, but price will still be an issue for widespread numbers, something that may or may not affect the Turbo Express extended console.

As far as games go, expect to see a whole lot of mediocre on the Nintendo, but keep your eyes peeled for the occasional super-hit that WILL appear from time to time. The Genesis will remain a powerhouse for some time, but more effort needs to be engineered into the games so that new types of play mechanics are introduced instead of the tried and true scrolling-shooters which will hit in a wave in '91. The Turbo will still enjoy the usual mix of good and bad in an effort to bring some hot stuff to the screen. It will appear in '91, but NEC has to continue to press third-party support from Japan, either under their own label or independents, to make the Turbo the super machine it can be.

The future of the video game industry is filled with bright lights, all we need to do is see through the fog of price discounts and poor quality games that surrounds them.

20,Real-Life Video Game Warriors,"
As I sit in front of my trusty computer, tapping out my latest observations from the electronic gaming world, the CES convention has just ended and the war against Iraq is just two days old. While I had planned to dedicate this space to express some personal opinions that were formed at the Consumer Electronics Show in regards to new product, a very interesting bit of reporting has continued to illuminate the tube.

One after one the allied pilots who have been forced to take the military option in response to Saddam Hussein's plundering of Kuwait have appeared on television trying to describe the sensations of modern air war-fare. With all of its high-tech trappings and extensive use of computers for sighting enemy targets, the closest thing any of the top guns interviewed could compare the real-life battle with is -you guessed it- a video game.

It's not hard for me to understand how this could be. From the cockpit video tapes that have played so far, the electronic sightings that today's jet fighters employ look just like something out of an After Burner game. Even though you don't feel the physical strain that our heroes in the gulf experience when they perform incredible aerial acrobatics, the actual look of air-to-air and air-to-ground combat is very much the same.

Could this mean that the skills that are needed to perform well on the video game screen can translate into useful talents in other parts of your life? The argument for video games being a great vehicle for improving hand-eye coordination have been reinforced by our soldiers in the gulf. It's tragically unfortunate that the men and women of our armed services need to be present in this conflict at all. But it's also reassuring to know that any threat to democracy and freedom can be destroyed.

How was the show, you might ask?

Besides the fact that the show was held inside what amounted to be little more than glorified green houses (which always seemed to be either too hot or too cold), the Winter CES in Las Vegas did see the introduction of some new hardware, a behind-the-doors peek at the 16-Bit Nintendo and more softs than you can imagine!

Having sampled what the Super Famicom can do, it was a little disappointing that Nintendo chose not to make a stronger announcement for their high-end console, but not that surprising. At Nintendo's press conference, the powers that be at the big N' did little more than promise to sell four billion dollars worth of equipment once again this year, including two million Super NES's in just over three months time. That means Nintendo plans to sell twice as many units as the Genesis in roughly an eighth of the time. Sure it's optimistic, but it also lets Nintendo fill in a 20% decline in sales with a new product line.

This issue is dedicated to the CES show by delivering our bi-annual photo-excursion through the show, spotlighting all the softs that were on display. It's also dedicated to our armed forces: may peace bring them safely home.

21,The Power of Rumors,"
Earlier this month Nintendo and Sony jointly announced in Japan that they are working on a new CD player for the Super Famicom. That alone is not spectacular news as rumors about such a peripheral have been circulating ever since the Super Fami was debuted last September. But up until now everything was just that - a rumor. Something to talk about when friends get together to argue which 16 bit system is better and has more potential. Now though, it has gone beyond the rumor stage, it is a fact. What is more surprising is that this CD player is already past the prototype stage since Nintendo plans to have it out and in the stores (in Japan) by the end of the year. And, that later this month it will be shown behind closed doors at one of the trade shows.

There's more. Unlike the NEC or Sega unit, the Nintendo player is rumored not to be inexpensive. Instead of selling for $300 to $400, the price being discussed is just under 100,000 yen ($750). And that it will not be compatible with the current generation of CD players. Now the story is getting interesting. Analysts speculate that this CD player is going to do more than just play back games. They are predicting that this CD player will serve as a hub around which a whole new generation of machines will interact. It is known that Nintendo is interested in getting more involved in the home information data base market. And Sony is also thinking along those lines. A new generation of machines though? The Super Fami is less than a year old!

But the long range potential of the CD is too hard to turn ones back on. NEC has led the way in showing us how much better a CD game sounds and plays. And Data East/Intel has demonstrated how the CD-ROM player can be used to usher in a new generation of truly interactive arcade games. So will Nintendo be the first to use the potential of the CD to go beyond games? Right now it's all speculation.

If we look at this issue from another view, it is amazing how a well placed rumor (a very short nondescript press statement) can get a whole industry wondering about something that doesn't even exist yet. It's not a new idea. A major American company in the early '80s was very well known for creating vaporware'. It gets the players talking, and even influences their future buying decisions. The huge amount of letters that we get in every month about the Sega CD-ROM goes a long way to prove how important rumors are to companies. In just knowing that better equipment is on the horizon, players can see that what they bought today will last a while longer.

So is the Nintendo CD-ROM for real, or is it something created to take some of the attention away from the upcoming Sega CD-ROM? One thing is for sure, that short announcement from Nintendo/Sony got a free page of advertisement here in this column. And it also got 400,000 players wondering about what the big N is really up to. Now which major company wants a free page where we can talk about a rumor regarding the first 32 bit system?

22,EGM Review Policy,"
One of the nice things about this job is to be able to sit back on a weekend and go through the hundreds of letters that you send in each week. This gives us an indication as to what you like and dislike and it also helps us decide what to review in the upcoming issues.

An area which has been of great interest is the way we structure our game reviews. While not new to the players who have been reading our mag for a while, there are thousands of new readers, and dozens of new game companies who want to know more about how, and when we evaluate the games.

Unlike other mags which combine everything in one shot, we have split our game reviews into three distinct and different processes. We feel that games don't just happen', they evolve, and that is what we show. It is a three step process that lets you follow along as a game becomes final.

The first step in the life of a game is it's appearance in our Next Wave col-umn. This section of the magazine is devoted to showing you the very first pictures of the upcoming games. These softs could be anywhere from 3 to 6 months away from production and they could be either photos supplied by the manufacturer or from a 20% to 30% complete prototype. The purpose is to show you what is on the horizon. This helps us deliver the first facts and photos on new games like Ninja GaiDen 3 to give you an initial indication of what the game will be like.

Next, if the game is worthy of additional attention, it moves to our Fact-File. In this section we will take a game that is anywhere from nearing completion and blow it apart to give you even more detailed info. This include all the boss-es, weapons, power-ups, special techniques, characters and maps of some or all of the levels. The text that accompanies the Fact-File will describe the plot of the game and some of the techniques used. The fact file then shows you, in great detail, what the game is about. The maps show you the length and shape of the levels, while the photos of all of the items display how much variety is built in. The game is now about two months from production. At this point we get the best information from the company about the tentative release date and cart memory configuration. Being able to see all the elaborate backgrounds and unique features in a game like Metal Storm, helps you decide whether it is the type of game that you will enjoy. Also, since we have an elaborate system to collect photos, we can bring you action that you won't find anywhere else! We never will use the stock' screen shots that other mags do because we know that you don't want to see the same pix in EGM!

Lastly, when a finished ROM is available we give the game to our Review Crew for the magazine's formal evaluation. Each member of the Crew reviews the game independently to its end, focusing on over a dozen items ranging from sound effects and background music to graphics and game play. All of this gets boiled down to our number rating system and the features that are exceptional (either good or bad) are described in the text. These reviews are then run in the issue that coincides with the game's release.

We think this process works, and judging from your letters, so do you. But, as always, we would be interested in your further thoughts. If you have more suggestions on how we can improve the quality of our reviewing process, please drop us a letter and let us know!

23,"1,000,000 Readers!","Sounds impressive! We were pleasantly surprised when the results from our survey came in. Back in January we decided that just being a magazine wasn't enough. We wanted to help promote the industry! After thinking a while about how to best go about this process we decided on a theme - interaction. The first step was to include a Reader Service Card in each issue. Not only would we be helping our readers by putting them in touch with all of the key hardware and software companies in the country, but, we would also be helping the companies get in touch with the players who are interested in their specific products! At the same time we wanted to learn more about the type of players who read our magazine. By knowing more about you, we can modify our mag to best serve your interests. And, over the past few issues the book has been evolving. You say you want more pages, you got it! We're at 132 now, and rising! You want insert magazines - we're doing it! NEC, Micro Gaming, Lynx, Robo Cop 2 and Electronic Arts over the past 4 issues. You want expanded coverage on all that is new. You got it - Neo-Geo, Super Famicom, Lynx and Game Gear. You want news even faster than once a month. You got it, Our EGM weekly 900 number gives you REAL news, reviews and tips not seen in previous issues of the magazine. And we're not done yet. Over the next few months you will see things that have never been done before!

But back to the headline. While we would love to sell a million copies every month we aren't there yet. But over a million players read each issue of EGM! There's a difference between the two statements. From our survey we found out that after you are done reading EGM you pass it on to several of your friends so they also can get the latest and best info on the gaming industry. This pass-on' readership, when added to our paid circulation, gets us to the over 1,000,000 mark. Is it important? To our readers, probably not. But if I was an advertiser, I would like to hear that number.

We've learned other things about our readers. Over two thirds of you are between the ages of 11 and 17. The next largest segment is the 18 to 25 group. And both of these groups combined make up almost 90 percent of our readership! These are the serious game players, as over 50% of you own 16 or more games and purchase more than a dozen games per year. The NES is the most popular system with 70% of our readers owning one. But you don't stop with just one system. Almost 33% have the Genesis; 21% GameBoy; 19% TurboGrafx; 10% Master System and 5% have a Lynx. That is the profile of a typical' EGM reader. And from your letters and calls the one item that is requested most often is that you want the latest information on what is new in the industry. We couldn't agree more! We want you to fee that the cover price is money worth spent. That you learned something new To this end, check out our international section starting on page 76. You'll see pictures of Super Famicom, Mega Drive and PC Engine games that even the U.S. companies haven't seen yet!

We may not be at the 1,000,000 mark yet, but we're on our way!

24,It's Showtime!,"
Having just finished this issue, we now have a couple of calm days before things get hectic again when the Summer Consumer Electronics Show begins on June 1st here in Chicago. We're really looking forward to this one as the veil of secrecy will finally be lifted from the Super Nintendo. While the hardware is not a surprise, the whole country is going to be watching what Nintendo (and Sega and NEC) is going to do after the S-NES introduction. Nintendo expects to sell millions of systems and they are willing to back that claim with millions in advertising through the holidays. Knowing the power, market savvy, and track record of Nintendo, their forecasts could just become a reality. By the time the system comes out this fall, the first batch of software will be in place and the market will be ready. It sounds so easy. But that assumes the other players will just roll over and play dead.

Sega doesn't plan to give up. For the last year they have been working quite secretly on a line-up of new super softs. Where the S-NES programmers are just learning their system, the Sega people are starting to bring out the second generation of Genesis games. Sonic the Hedgehog, Fantasia and Streets of Rage are good examples of the new breed of games. For example, Streets of Rage walks all over Final Fight as it is a 2 player game, has more moves (21 vs 17), more weapons (6 vs 3), and more on-screen enemies (8 vs 5). It's not that the Genesis is better, rather, it's due to the skill of the programmer. Look for some spectacular carts this fall. Unfortunately the Genesis CD-ROM will not play a part in the new Nintendo vs Sega war as it is, at best, a 1992 product, but Sega will instead drop their system price to $149. Expect them to do even more this fall.

And what about NEC? They have already lowered their system price to $99. The CD-ROM is down to $299. And they are continuing to push back the limits of CD-ROM full motion video technology. At CES they will demonstrate the potential of their NID (New Interactive Display) CDROM data compression technology. And in Japan they will show the next generation of their CD-ROM player. You can't count out NEC either.

So it's going to be a good show, and even a better holiday season with system prices the lowest ever and game quality the highest! I can't wait.

As a final note, all of us here at EGM would like to congratulate our Desert Storm troops on a job well done. We sincerely appreciate all that you did for us, and the free world. The risks you took, and sacrifices that you made can not be measured. We thank you for what you did. Should you, or any member of your family want to subscribe to any of our publi-cations, we would like to offer that subscription at half price. Just send in the request on your unit's stationary and we will reduce the price by 50 percent. It's our way of saying thanks!

25,EGM Spans The Globe!,"
One of our main goals here at EGM is to put out a magazine which contains the most current video game information in the country. Our foreign correspondents have been able to supply us with the very latest info from Japan, but the video game industry is changing. In the past, the majority of games came from Japan but now a larger percentage of software is being developed in England, France and Germany. Accordingly, we are now expanding our International coverage to include software from these countries.

Also, ever since we became the authoritative source for games in the U.S., other magazines from around the world have come to us asking for permission to reprint information from EGM in their magazine. That gave us an idea. Why not create a worldwide network of game magazines? Information would be traded between magazines and everybody would benefit! After several months of meetings between the best game magazines in the world, the World Net was formed. If you liked what we did in the past, wait till you see what we can do, now that we span the globe!

Another change that you may have noticed in EGM is the running of special insert publications. We have just set up a separate division here at Sendai called the Contract Publishing Group. This group will be solely responsible for the creation of the inserts which you will see here in EGM and in other publications. These inserts will highlight and describe specific products from different companies in the game industry. To avoid any confusion these inserts are advertisements, and they are paid for by the respective companies. However, they are more than just ads. Since they are prepared by people who know games, these inserts will be informative. They will show and describe all the products of the respective companies. A good example of this is the Atari Lynx insert. It shows you everything you ever wanted to know about the Lynx. It gives you an insight, with pictures, of all the new games coming out in the near future. It is something that you would want to pick up and read. And, from the letters we have received, it appears that you like these kind of ads. More are scheduled to run in the upcoming months. Check them out and drop us a note as to what you think.

26,EGM Pioneers Editors' Choice Awards!,"
How many times has this happened to you? You want to buy a game and you're at the store. You look at the boxes and from the information printed on the packagegame description and screen shots, you buy the cart. Only to find out that it's too easy, or it just wasn't what you expected. That's $50+ down the drain. If it's any consolation, you're not alone. I'm reading dozens of similar letters each week. What makes it even worse is the fact that many of you are not buying these softs blindly. Quite a few players are getting the carts after reading a review from the experts'. But the problem is that many of the reviews are either always great or noncommittal. How many times have you read the overused phrase ..if you like these types of gamesthen you'll like this one. It's great for the magazine as the game manufacturer won't get upset, but the reader is left out in the cold.

We've taken our lumps for our honesty. In the past we lost advertisers because we gave one of their carts a less than average rating. But what we lost in ads we gained in loyal reader support. And your support helped us grow to be the best (and the largest) magazine in the industry. The advertisers have come back because you have told them that you read EGM. How? From our reader response cards that you fill out, for one. Each month these advertisers get a list of thousands and thousands of players that want more info on their products. Also by company focus groups'. This is the best test. Bring in a couple dozen players and put the game magazines on a table. Later they ask the players to rate the mags. And the answer.EGM. We've been honest, and you've been honest in your opinions. For this we thank you.

One of the many reasons why you buy our magazine is for our honest, mul-tiperson review crew ratings of the new games. We have four players review every game, and each has his own particular likes and dislikes. Over time you will probably find yourself agreeing with one or another, and can take his numbers to be similar to what you would rate the game. But when all four agree that a certain title is great, then that cart is really outstanding.

These exceptional carts are now getting special attention. If the sum of all four of the reviewer's numbers is between 32 and 35 (all 8's or better) the company will be awarded a gold Editors' Choice Award. If the game gets a 36 rating (all 9's) they will get a platinum award. The company can then use these awards in their advertising, on their packaging or anywhere they see fit.

The one thing though, when you see the award you know it means something. No candy coating, and not the opinion of a single person, just the straight story from four players who are hard to impress.

27,"Big, Bigger, Biggest!","
As you probably have already noticed, this issue of EGM is pretty large. Two hundred and four pages and it's our largest issue yet! We've come a long way since this time last year when we were at 84 pages, but we're not one to look back for too long. Having hit 200 we now will shoot for 250 and even more by the end of the year. Of course we couldn't do it without the support and confidence of the advertisers and readers. We've grown fast because we have been able to evolve quickly to meet the needs of the gaming industry. Contract publishing is but one example of what the industry, and the readers wanted. Also, with lead times measured in weeks rather than in 3-4 months, you get to read about items which can still be called news. Game reviews are honest, and sometimes downright brutal. Fortunately companies now realize, that with cart rentals so popular, players will more often than not, rent games before they buy them, and whether we give the game a 3, or the kids rent it and see that it is bad, all the smiling faces in the world won't make it better.

And we're on a roll! More pages means we can cover more games, for more systems, with more pictures and more information. Considering all the new games coming out by the holidays the other 100 page books just can't cover everything sufficiently. Look for expanded coverage in our arcade section, new supplements and inserts, more fact files and, of course, more multi-person game reviews.

Speaking of supplements, you will have to check out the huge 96 page Sega Force supplement in this issue. Anybody who owns a Sega system will find virtually every licensed product available. And then some! Don't forget to check out the Sonic Comic! If you don't own a Genesis, Game Gear or Master System 2 then reading through the supplement might help you change your mind. Of special note is the fact that this is the first authorized Sega magazine outside of their own publication. We appreciate the trust that they have in us to fairly describe their products. As usual, it's here first, and then, only in EGM!

28,The State of the Industry,"
It is a welcome honor to once again be contributing to the editorial page of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. Much has changed, both at EGM and in the industry at large, since the last time I contributed to this section of the magazine almost a year ago, but these important events have done nothing but strengthen my belief that video games are here to stay.

In your hands you now hold the largest video game magazine ever made for American game players. It's the culmination of many hours of fun and games, not to mention a strong commitment made to you by both the staff of EGM and the dozens of video game publishers that are now producing softs for systems ranging from the Nintendo to the Super NES. The industry recognizes the important role we play and many of the most important companies have chosen to use our pages to deliver their important messages to you.

From the very beginning of EGM our goal was to always deliver the hottest information, be it a game system in secret development or a hidden playing tip, and with dozens of exclusive announcements we feel we've fulfilled this job with info as good as can be found. EGM now has representatives in both Europe and Japan and has continued to expand its global reach by forming World-Net, a special organization of leading video game magazine publishers. We have always tried to be prompt in our reporting and, as always, we greatly appreciate any feedback you can give us on our performance.

We've also reached out to our advertisers to create interactive inserts that will not only attract you to new games, but will also be helpful in playing your favorite titles. In this issue Atari has provided you with a special 32-page mini-magazine that highlights their new library of games, not to mention similar supplements from SNK Home Entertainment and Electric Avenue.

You'll also find a new regular feature in this edition of EGM! Through a special agreement with the American Amusement Machine Association, the governing body of the coin-op video game industry, EGM will represent the arcade game manufacturers with a section that focuses on the high-tech advances that these games possess over their smaller console counterparts. Be sure to check out our coverage of the AMOA convention as well as the first pix of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2!

Many of your most popular sections have also been expanded thanks to EGM's new size and scope! You'll find not one, not two but three Super Play specials, with mega maps and intense game tips on Ninja GaiDen 3, Sonic the Hedgehog and Super R-Type. Other features include Batman-The Return of the Joker, Rolling Thunder 2 and Super Ghouls and Ghosts which is part of our Super NES special.

In short, EGM gives you more! More tricks, more maps, more reviews and more pages! While other video game magazines are giving you less info and increasing their cover price by as much as a dollar, EGM is providing almost three times as much news, reviews and previews for the same low price! While it may not be true of the other guys, the only thing you'll ever see EGM increase is the size of the magazine!

I wish to thank you for supporting EGM over the past year and hope that you enjoy the many new and exciting additions we have planned for all of our video game publications in 1992. You can rest assured that EGM will remain the biggest and best thanks to your loyal support!

29,The EGM Difference,"
As I sit back on Halloween night to assemble my monthly collection of gaming thoughts, I can't help but look back and where we've been in the last year. Being the last issue of 1991, I've convinced myself that there would be no better place to catalogue the achievements that the video game hobby has made in the past twelve months. By the same token, l've also decided to share some of my personal observations related to where the industry seems to be heading in 1992.

First and foremost, 1991 saw the first real explosion of 16-Bit inter-est, spurred on largely by Nintendo and the long-awaited release of their Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Coinciding with this unveiling, Sega promptly dropped their price below the $150 mark, while NEC chopped the price of the Turbo down to half of what it was when originally introduced

The appearance of 16-Bitters on the scene, combined with a general lack of initiative by most 8-Bit licensees, delivered the first nail in the coffin of the NES. Although there are still 30 million units in play, you can't help but wonder how many of the tried and true Nintendo users who had the cash and the broad interest in gaming to support the more obscure titles haven't already moved up to one 16-Bit system or the other. Sure, the NES still has plenty of life in it, but witness the actions of Nintendo themselves (releasing one game for the holiday season) and you only reinforce the idea that a handful of softs will continue to power the vast majority of the systems.

Last year also saw handheld gaming peak with the delivery of the Sega Game Gear. Now sharing shelf space with the likes of the Nintendo GameBoy and Atari Lynx, the variety of games and hardware configurations open to the player have never been greater.

We also got to meet some revolutionary game characters in 1991! Although we had all met Mario before, his latest adventure in 16-Bit provided a variety of all-new thrills. And don't forget Sonic the Hedgehog! His wayward manner and ultra-crisp graphics gave Sega the recognition that the company and its hardware have deserved for so long.

Where are we going in 1992 and beyond? CD games seem the natural progression, but not without some hitches. It's difficult for game companies to put the $500,000 commitment behind a top quality CD-ROM or CD-I production (as opposed to $100,000-$150,000 for the average cartridge game) when the potential market is 1/100th the size the base of cart users. Price is also a factor, since most CD game players now range $300.00 and up.

No matter what the new innovations are, or what the hot new character of 1992 may be, you can rest assured that EGM will be there covering it first! With a staff of avid game players, like you, we have the ability to spot the trends and hot new games of tomorrow, today.

That's the EGM difference.

30,The Only Constant is Change,"
The only constant is change.

This adage rings particularly true in the video game industry where new technology and changing play themes dictate the difference between yesterday's has-beens and tomorrow's marvels.

We have been witness to some incredible changes in the last twelve months. Nintendo finally got around to releasing their 16-Bit Super NES, Sega scored big with Sonic the Hedgehog and NEC got next generation game play in an affordable package. These events don't even begin to touch on the countless number of video game carts that have appeared for all the above systems as well as the 8-Bit Nintendo and the family of portable machines now on the market. 1991 was indeed a staggering year in the world of electronic gaming.

Amazingly, as we gaze ahead to see what 1992 and 1993 have in store for gaming enthusiasts like you and me, the future just seems to get brighter. Super-charged CD-ROMs from NEC and Sega, compatible with existing game hardware as well as new formats from Sony and Phillips that take advantage of CD-I configurations promise limitless possibilities in interactive video discs. You can bet that cartridge-based systems will still get some heavy use, and we may even see some additional cart-only platforms like the Jaguar from Atari within the next twelve months.

Keeping up with the changes and introductions in the ever-expanding electronic entertainment field is no easy taskespecially when you're privy to it all. But Electronic Gaming Monthly has increased its size to accommodate the latest additions to your favorite hobby so that adequate and accurate coverage can be given to all game formats. In the months to come you can look forward to even more sections devoted to higher-end gaming systems as we keep pace with the industries and enthusiasts this magazine is pledged to support.

Beginning with this issue and continuing through our March, 1992 edition, you're going to see many new changes to the familiar Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine you've been buying for the last three years. We'll be delivering more advance news from around the world, more previews of upcoming titles for American systems and continue to be the first with the hottest maps, tips and tricks available.

The most noticeable changes, however, will come in the way we present our leading edge information. Our game previews and reviews will be revamped beginning with our next issue to make them more informative as well as easier to read. Again, we're making these changes to insure that you're getting the very best video game magazine on the market in a package that is as interactive as it is useful.

Please let us know what you think about the changes we're instituting and feel free to send in your suggestions and comments on how we can make EGM even better for you. After all, our end goal is to create a publication that we can all call our own.

31,It's That Time of Year Again,"
Well, it's that time of year again!

The silly season has died down, the Vegas CES is just around the corner, and it's a perfect time to gauge where we're going and where we've been.

This year, more than any before, showed the greatest change in the electronic entertainment industry. Not only did we witness the introduction of new game machines like the Super NES, but other systems like the Sega Genesis finally came into their own. Prices on several formats came down, with the NEC TurboGrafx-16 finally reaching below 100 bucks. And don't forget the leaps in software production that mini-machines like the Lynx and Game Gear made in '91.

For all the truly incredible movement forward, however, the game industry has also started to experience some downscaling. The Nintendo 8-Bit NES, long the staple of the gamer's diet, has been eclipsed by the more powerful 16-Bitters, no matter what Nintendo says. The hobby is definitely becoming more upscale, which will have some negative effects in the short term but should balance out over the long haul.

1991 saw a number of other events occur that will have a significant impact on the market as a whole in 1992. Although originating from a competitor, a tip of the hat goes to the first real television program to cover our hobby. The point isn't whether it's good or bad, but that it's on at all is a testament to its creators and the gaming public. Will we see more television programming covering our favorite hobby? You betcha - and in a way unlike anything you've ever seen before!

Aside from all the giant steps forward video gaming has made since its rebirth in 1985, the question we have to ask ourselves is where are we going to?

The Winter Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas will likely be the place where the future balance of power within the video game industry will play itself out. Sega, coming off of a banner year (complete with a holiday season that saw sell-outs across the board) will enter this show, for the first time, on top. Although Nintendo may claim superiority, the truth of the here and now is that Sega leveled their arch-nemesis with a lower-priced left and a Sonic right. Being in the leading position will feel good to everyone at Sega and they should enjoy it and work hard to continue their progress.

Nintendo, however, cannot be counted out or even down for that matter. If Sega does not come up with some equally stunning softs to follow-up Sonic (a sequel to which will be available mid-year), they will be eclipsed by Nintendo, who's legion of third-party producers will net us Street Fighter 2, Contra 3 and a plethora of other stunning titles throughout 1992. Sure, quantity favors Sega, but with the knowledge of what Nintendo will produce in 1992, the quality factor will tip to the big N's' camp without further forward action from Sega.

Ultimately, the big winner will be us, the game playing enthusiasts who relish each new hardware introduction (which there are sure to be in '92) and marvel at the incredible steps the game developers make with each new game program. The 16-Bit competition will necessitate better softs from both Nintendo and Sega which, as the leading magazine of honest game reviews, will make our job all the more fun.

Lastly, to respond to the growing change within the video game field, you'll see additional changes to the magazine in this and coming months.

32,CES Impressions,"
We're back from the Consumer Electronics Show and it was a real treat to be able to have the opportunity to play all of the new carts that the companies are working on. While I have been attending all of the shows since video games started way back in the 1970s, each one turns out to be a new experience. There always is new technology, peripherals, accessories and of course, tons of games. This show was probably the best yet. With the 16-Bit wars starting to really heat up it is interesting to sit back and see how the major players stack up against each other. Last summer it was Sonic vs Mario and the Super Nintendo and this time it was quite different.

Nintendo really came out swinging. Their licensees have been working long and hard trying to improve on the first generation of Super Nintendo games. It was easy to see that they have done their homework as this new generation of carts have very little slow down or flicker. Programmers are trying new things with the Mode 7 and some of the games we played are setting new standards of excel-lence. Turtles 4 by Konami has your player throwing the enemy out of the screen towards you! Out of this World by Interplay makes extensive use of filled polygon graphics in a story book like adventure. Of course there are the arcade games, no CES analysis would be complete without mentioning the spectacular Street Fighter 2. Not only is it the worlds first 16 megabit cartridge but this super soft is probably the best arcade to home system translation ever made. It is that good! Throw in other hot titles like Super Battletoads, Contra 3 and Bart's Nightmare and we can say now that this system is really starting to evolve into a Super Nintendo Entertainment System. If that impressive line-up of software wasn't enough to dominate the show, Nintendo quietly dropped the bomb on the competition by announcing the specs to their new CD-ROM peripheral. Specs can be deceiving but with 8 meg of memory, full motion video capability and a coprocessor it sounds impressive. The best partNintendo says it will only cost $200!!

NEC/Turbo Technologies wasn't on the floor but they had a very impressive display of titles which they plan to bring over from Japan as soon as they get up and running (April 1, 1992). They also confirmed that they will make a U.S. equivalent to the PC Engine Duo in addition to releasing a new Super System card to play the new Super discs. Behind closed doors they were showing their not to secret 32 bit machine.

Sega, historically, never has a lot to show at the January event. Such was the case this year. The Mega CD was behind closed doors and the cartridge games were basically updates of some of the older sports games. Holyfield has his name on a new boxing cart, the baseball game has a nonstop voice like their Joe Montana football and there is a new D & D RPG. No Sonic 2, no Batman 2, no Phantasy Star 4 and no mention of new things to come.

The Neo-Geo booth was buzzing with activity as SNK had a few spectacular carts to show. Last Resort, Fatal Fury and Andro Dunos had constant lines of people waiting to play these games. This is going to be one hot system this year.

Overall, the show belonged to Nintendo. They had the carts, the technology and the wherewithal to open the R & D doors a crack to show everybody what was coming out in the future! If they say they will sell 6 million systems this year, they just might do it with a line-up as good as we saw, and this is only the first 6 months of 1993! | can't wait to see what they will have in June!

33,What Shape Will The Future Take?,"
Lately there has been a lot of talk concerning what roads the video game hobby potentially could take in the months to come, as well as an equally diverse amount of speculation concerning which game formats will take hold in this and subsequent years.

While this argument has been debated in previous Insert Coin and letters sec-tions, it has recently become a hot topic once again. Not since early 1989 have there been so many new types of hardware on the horizon. These range from new formats like the Sega Mega CD, Nintendo CD-ROM and Sony Play Station, to revamped versions of existing technology soon to be unveiled in the Nintendo Color GameBoy and the upcoming NES to Super NES convertor.

Even though it is encouraging to see that the video game industry is still a vibrant business that many perceive have the necessary life left to warrant the costs into such areas, there are other questions that plague my thoughts whenever I hear someone unilaterally placing CD or another technology in an automatic place of preeminence above the current cartridge format.

While these machines of the future are stealing the headlines, cartridge based gaming is making equally impressive leaps. Witness this month's cover story, Street Fighter 2 for the Super NES. This is a game that millions have been waiting for and Capcom is well aware of that fact. But instead of producing a limited version of the arcade super-hit, or trimming the more subtle features to compress the game into a more conventional four or eight megabit configuration, the programmers were instead let loose with 16 meg of memory. The result is a game that, although expensive, cannot be compared to any arcade-to-home conversion ever attempted. Street Fighter 2 is the perfect example of how technology doesn't dictate playability - it's the game that does.

The future is exciting, but when you consider that since Nintendo introduced their 8-Bit system seven years ago there have only been three other companies strongly committed to delivering new game formats to the market (a trend that doesn't seem to be changing much outside of CD-ROM). Perhaps the new technologies will bring with them new game designs that challenge our senses in altogether new ways that Nintendo, Sega and Atari never dreamed of.

Electronic Gaming Monthly remains committed to the electronic entertainment industry and all of the changes that have yet to come. Whether it's CD-ROM or new mega-carts like Street Fighter 2, EGM will be there with the first news and a guarantee that are viewpoints will always provide you with the info you need to buy the best products and get the most out of them.

I would like to take this time, as I do every year, to invite your opinions and comments on the state of the industry and the manner in which EGM has taken you through the twists and turns of our hobby. This is your magazine and, as we continue to expand onto television and with additional publications, we want to make absolutely sure that the future of video games and our content are one in the same.

34,"CD-ROM, Is The Industry Ready For It?","
We are about to witness the beginning of a whole new generation of video games. While it only seems like yesterday that we made the jump from 8 to 16 bit gaming, very soon, we will leap from 16 bit cartridge to 16 bit CD-ROM entertainment. It all begins at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show when Sega (and possibly Nintendo) will unveil this new generation of games.

There is a problem though. While the technology is there (NEC has had a CD-ROM out for a couple of years) the industry - the game designers and programmers, may not be ready yet. Take, for example, the problems that NEC had with their unit. The hardware worked fine, but there was no software. Without a constant flow of good software, few game players would buy the system.

Also consider the launch of Sega's Mega CD-ROM in Japan last December. The price was very high49,800* ($380), but more importantly, the software was few and far between, and then it was at best, cartridge games with CD audio. Like the NEC unit, the Mega CD-ROM sold well for a short while, then the player interest dropped off quickly. Now, the system is already being heavily discounted32,500 or less than $250.

The problemJapan rushed the Mega CD out the door without the software. The programmers weren't to blame, as sources have told me that the Mega CD is a very complex system to program for. The more features the unit has the more that has to be learned, and the longer it takes to get out a good piece of software.

Is Sega ready for CES? Or are they also rushing the technology? The original Sonic the Hedgehog cartridge took 1 1/2 years to program. The Mega CD-ROM development systems have been in programmers hands for less than 6 months. Is that enough learning time to get spectacular software on the market? The kind of games that cause the players to rush out and buy the systems. Or will we start off like Japan with cartridge games and CD music? It is probable that we will be somewhere in between. There will be enough Wow!' type CDs at the show to build interest, but the Fall launch of the system will only have a couple of spectacular games. Early 1993 is about the time when the really good games will be ready.

This is only the software side of the problem. Can Sega bring the unit out for an affordable price? Will Nintendo really stick to their $200 figure? What about the pack-in CD? Will Sonic be ready? What will Nintendo do? The questions go on and on.

Officials at Sega say that they are considering all of the possible variables, and that it won't be until the actual day of the show that a decision will be made. It's going to be a tough one to make, indeed. It's kind of exciting though. I, for one, can't wait till the show to see what happens. I only hope that they aren't rushing the technology.

35,Something Funny Happened On My Way To The Consumer Electronics Show,"
As all die-hard EGM readers know by now, the Consumer Electronics Show is the definitive showcase for everything new in video games. Both good and bad softs receive equal attention in the spotlight of new products at the CES, providing gaming editors like myself with an unparalleled opportunity to see into the future and test firsthand what promises it holds.

It's also a decent place to pay twelve bucks for a piece of pizza in a cafeteria with inadequate seating.

But what's more important than the open bazaar spirit of the show is the ways in which it consistently, year after year, manages to instill new faith in the video game industry to those who are lacking, and focus even stronger attention on those products that are worthy of additional attention. It also provides EGM with a chance to visit the 100+ booths and display areas throughout the convention hall and surrounding hotels to snap the first pictures of the games you'll be playing tomorrow. In short, the CES not only succeeds as a trade show that caters to the movers and shakers in the video game industry that get the hottest titles from computer screens to store shelves, it also provides a unique chance for video game publications to pass on a sneak peek at what's just over the horizon.

But something funny happened on my way to this year's show. The organizers of the CES decided to unlock the doors which had, since the show's inception, kept the public from getting a direct look at what the future had in store for all of us. The 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show will be open to everyone - and everyone will be highly surprised to see just what the CES is all about.

For the game player it will undoubtedly prove to be the ultimate video game wonderland. Those lucky enough to attend will be privy to the first information on hot hits like Street Fighter 2, Turtles 4, Batman Returns and Sonic 2. You'll also see the American version of the Mega CD-ROM drive for the Genesis in action and get special screenings of the GameBoy Game Genie, Sony Play Station and new TTI Duo game machine. The CES will provide all who attend with the sensation of exactly what it's like to be the editor of a video game magazine. Even though our editors have played many of the biggest titles for months, there will still be many more softs and hardware previews that the EGM cameras have never been exposed to before.

And for those of you who do attend, you can sure bet that EGM will be there on the floor with you! In addition to passing out preview copies of the July edition of EGM to qualified readers, our booth will contain many other special surprises ranging from a Street Fighter 2 competition (with a Street Fighter 2 arcade game and Street Fighter 2 Super NES carts as prizes) to a sneak preview of what is sure to be one of the hottest video game magazines ever pro-duced! In short, EGM is as excited to see you coming to the CES as you are, and we won't disappoint!

For those of you who can't make it to the Chicago party, don't worry! The EGM cameras will take in every new game, just as we've done in the past! We'll also deliver all the excitement from the show next issue in a special 32-page collector's magazine that highlights everything video games have to offer in the months to come! We look forward to seeing you!

36,The Return of Electronic Gaming,"
Oh, the times they are a changin.' I think it is a pretty good way to describe the video game industry, and especially the magazines that serve it. While other publications have changed, ranging from key people moving on, to major staff overhauls, we here at Sendai have been growing into a huge family of gaming enthusiasts just like you! In fact, over the past year, we have doubled the number of people bringing you EGM! We are constantly looking for, and hiring, the best people in the field to insure rapid growth and the best news and reviews you can find.

To this end I am very pleased to announce the addition of perhaps the best known editors in the industry to the Sendai staff. The names Arnie Katz, Bill Kunkel and Joyce Worley need no introduction. They have been writing about video games and computers since the late '70s and launched the very first magazine to serve the hobby. They now will edit a brand new multi-format magazine called Electronic Games. Older players will remember a magazine of the same name from back in the Atari 2600 days. The nineties version of Electronic Games should be on store shelves in a few months, with Katz, Kunkel and Worley, not to mention other staff such as the world renowned Game Doctor contributing on a regular basis. The Game Doctor, in addition to gaming's most famous editorial trio, will also have regular columns in EGM and our sister publication, Computer Game Review.

Why introduce Electronic Games when there already is an EGM, Mega Play, Super NES Buyer's Guide and Computer Game Review? The folks at Decker Publications, who will be producing the monthly magazine, feel that there isn't a good multi-format magazine on the market that is designed especially for the older, mature game player. EGM and our other specialty magazines will continue to sport the first news and photos of all that's hot in the gaming world, only now they will be enhanced with the combined experience and knowledge of Arnie Katz, Bill Kunkel, Joyce Worley and the Game Doctor. We're honored to have them on board

In other news, as you can see, along with this issue of EGM, there are several supplements and, most importantly, our semi-annual CES magazine. This time, we have made special arrangements to get the 32 page CES magazine to you even earlier than ever before! Last year we were first with full CES coverage in our August issue. This year we have bumped that up one month and you are reading this only a couple of weeks after the show! This is not a partial pre-CES compilation of data from phone calls and company prepared slides as you have seen from others. The photos you are looking at were taken over all four days of the show! We hope that you will like this special issue as much as we enjoyed putting it together!

While times are a changin', for us, and ultimately you the reader, we feel that this change is going to make a major impact on the entire industry. To that end we would like to paraphrase another popular expression from a rival industry: you lead, follow or get out of the way.

37,The System War' Heats Up!,"
If you were one of the unfortunate group of players who bought either the Genesis or Super Nintendo game systems last year you probably are not going to be too glad to hear that your $160 to $200 investment in a system has just been cut in half. Yes, the system war' is going great guns and neither Sega nor Nintendo will give the other company any chance to get a sales edge. Over the past 6 months the system prices have changed so often that retailers no longer have any idea as to what price to put on their inventory. As soon as the prices are changed, they have to be changed again, and always downward. However, it now looks like the prices have gone about as low as they can, as this last price cut necessitated major changes in the system configuration. Now, with only one controller and no pack-in cart the systems have apparently reached rock bottom.

While not great for the stores, the players who sat on the fence thinking about upgrading are enjoying every minute of the war. This Christmas shopping season (when about 60% of the toys are sold) should prove to be one of the best ever for the retailers. They will sell a lot of systems, but not make a lot of money. Still, don't feel too sad for the poor store owners as everything they will lose on the sale of the sys-tem, they will make up (and then some) on the sales of the games. There are not too many people who believe that a cartridge is really worth from $60 to $80. Camerica, for one, has proven with their Aladdin project that good games (albeit 8 bit carts) can be sold for less than $20.

Unfortunately, there are losers to this new 16 bit war. With the Super Nintendo at $99, how many older 8 bit NES' will Nintendo sell at $79? The handwriting was on the wall about the eventual demise of the NES though, as most of the licensees have already switched over their R & D efforts to S-NES game production.

Sega has to be smiling though. They have lowered their prices to the point where the NES users now can inexpensively upgrade to another system. Many of those will switch from Nintendo to Sega.

Another nice point is that the price war is spreading over into the portable area. This time it is Sega vs. Atari. Sega's Game Gear is coming down to $99 and Atari is rumored to be bringing the Lynx down around the $80 price point.

Who is going to win this latest war? It is quite possible that nobody will really ever know. Sales figures are provided by the companies and aren't audited. Nintendo claimed to have sold over two million systems in three months last year. Few analysts believe that number and place the actual amount as about half that amount. Now they are saying they will sell six million more Super Nintendo systems this year. Sega is stating that they will double their user base. Who is right? We'll have to wait until after Christmas to see. Until then, the one thing that we can count on is that the real winner will be the game players, as for the first time in gaming history, the new systems are actually priced at a point where almost everybody can afford to upgrade.

38,The Street Fighter 2 Phenomenon,"
O.K., by now virtually everybody in the country has the mega-hot Street Fighter 2. Sales for the first week that this soft was out set new records, and, judging from the hundreds of letters that we have already received, player satisfaction with this prime cart is at an all time high. As we have been saying for quite some time now, this is not just another popular game. It is, like its arcade cousins, a phenomenon, and that is why, month after month, we continue to devote more and more pages to this special cart. Also, because this is still the most popular game here at EGM, our crew continues to dive deeper and deeper into the soft, and, in the course of game playing, we are finding that there are a lot of hidden tricks buried in the program! Just as we had the exclusive news on the character vs. character trick last issue, we are now hot on the trail of the same color' character vs. character quirks. We have figured out how to do two of the characters, in both the normal' game and also in the champion edition color' game, so make sure you check out how to do them in our tricks section this issue. As we figure out how to do the trick with the other characters, you can bet that you will see it here first.

Game play aside, now that the cart is out, the demand for other SF2 paraphernalia has also increased. Players can't get enough of SF2. Accessories like specialized 6 button controllers, T-shirts, hats, posters, trading cards and practically anything with the SF2 logo on it are the hot items. Much of this is already available from Capcom and listed in the back of the instruction book, and, according to Capcom, more is on the way as they are actively licensing the SF2 characters and names. In addition, joystick companies are racing with each other, and Capcom, to get the first real 6 button controller on the market.

However, the impact of this game goes beyond just the software sales. Based on the letters that we have received, literally thousands of players have expressed such a strong interest in this game that they tell us that they will sell their existing game system and go out and buy the Super Nintendo just to be able to play the game!

This street fighting phenomenon isn't just limited to Capcom's Super Nintendo game either. SNK has just brought out a huge 87 meg fighting game called World Heroes for their NeoGeo system that has a strong resemblance to SF2. Sega is working on a 16 meg sequel to Streets of Rage, and there are at least a half dozen additional fighting-type games coming from various other Nintendo licensees.

How long will SF2 stay popular? Most likely through the holidays, but players have an insatiable appetite for new games, and those who have purchased the cart when it first came out are already inquiring about the possibility of the Champion Edition ever appearing on a home system (a rumor that Capcom states is completely untrue).

All in all, after the fact, a big tip of the hat has to go out to Capcom for all of the work they did in creating this phenomenon. It wasn't easy to pack an arcade game into a cartridge, and to be able to get enough of the product into the stores to meet the huge demand was quite a feat. But they did, and the end result is a game that has a good shot at being the game of the year! If you haven't tried the cart yet, give it a shot as it is highly addictive. Also, any game which gets a perfect 10 by not one, but two of our review crew has to be good!

39,A New Look for a New Generation of Games,"
The issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly you now hold in your hands is special for several reasons. The most noticeable change that you'll recognize between this and previous editions of EGM is undoubtedly the magazine's new structure and look. Using your valuable input, several months were taken to transform the best of what EGM was all about and put it into a new package that would be more informative, cooler to look at, and ultimately more fun to read.

The more important significance, however, is that this issue represents the fourth year of publication for Electronic Gaming Monthly! It has been a great time, and although we're still looking forward to the future, during my involvement with this specific issue of EGM I've found myself peering back at where we've been and how we got to where we're at today.

As all die-hard gamers know, things have changed drastically since our inception in 1988. Our first issues revolved around the fledgling Nintendo and Sega 8-Bit platforms. In those days, 16-Bit was nothing but a rumor (although EGM did have pictures and specs for the Super NES by June of '89) and portable gaming was relegated to the old single screen Tiger games that boasted big names but played like board games.

Any regular reader of Electronic Gaming Monthly has been witness to the launch of half of dozen new hardware formats, as well as a couple more that never quite got out of the box (remember the Konix system?). Same goes for new softwarethe integral engine that makes these machines move.

While some argue against delivering information on products that may never make it to these shores, Electronic Gaming Monthly has always invested in the future of the hobby by reporting on all the developments that impact the marketplace. It has remained one of our guiding philosophies to educate you, the consumer, with only the most honest game reviews from game players (not literary students who can't tell the difference between a power-up and 7-up) as well as delivering news of new softs and hardware from every corner of electronic gaming. We've always tried to bring you with us inside the industry so that through the pages of EGM you could sit next to the presidents and programmers who make video games so much fun to play.

So dig in to the new EGM! Whether you like Nintendo, Genesis, Super NES, Turbo Duo, NeoGeo, GameBoy, Game Gear, Lynx, arcade or international play, this is the mag that's got you covered!

40,The Biggest and Best Just Got Better,"
What you now hold in your hands is the largest video game magazine ever produced in America! Weighing in at 320 pages (sure, I know 48 of them comprise Electronic Boutique's new catalog, but they're cool too), this mega-gam-ing monstrosity is packed to the rim with all of the explosive color, hot news and secret info only EGM can deliver.

I know I speak for the rest of the EGM staff when I tell you that we've had an absolutely awesome time working to deliver the best video game mag around. As the size and scope of the magazine (not to mention the industry that it serves) change, you can count on us to be there with the first look at whatever the latest games, tips, or technology may be!

Although the video game industry has been able to mature at a zippy rate, all of this expansion has caused a nasty topic to rear its ugly head for the first time. The illegal copying of games is a problem that has been relegated to computer software in the past, but now threatens to take hold of the video game scene.

Using special devices that enable gaming pirates to download programming code, a few small bands of unscrupulous gamers have started duplicating favorite games for mass consumption within their clicks. Although the extent of the disease is small, largely because of the high cost and unavailability of the illegal hardware needed to copy, it does exist and is against the law.

Electronic Gaming Monthly recognizes the hard work and large investments that video game developers and manufacturers continue to make to bring us the hottest new games that cut the leading edge of technology. By illegally copying any video game, potential pirates hurt the hobby by decreasing overall sales. Even if the game is an older title, the integrity of the product remains the same and should not, under any circumstances, be violated.

Recently Electronic Gaming Monthly has instituted a company policy that mandates an end to illegal video game duplication. We are working with a number of major video game licensees to isolate the perpetrators of illegal game copying in an effort to bring about an end to this new form of crime. If you are aware of any such activities, or if you know the names of companies offering illegal video game duplication equipment, please contact me personally, attention: Game Pirates.

Getting back to the magazine, I hope you get into this issue of EGM as much as we did when we were making it! The holiday season is shaping up to be a blast and I'm glad that you've turned to the Biggest and Best Video Game Magazine for all your gaming needs. And don't forget to hold onto this special collector's issue - after all it's the biggest mag the states have ever seen!

At least until next month!

41,Can the Biggest and Best Get Even Bigger and Better?,"
That was the question all of us asked each other last month. After working long and hard for the past three months on EGM's new look, we sat back and looked over the November issue. Most importantly, we waited for your response. Every letter, fax and call that came in got our undivided attention, and while we were encouraged with all of the positive comments, we felt that there still was room for improvement. There were some areas which could be made even better.

Readers liked the large size of the November mag, so we made this one even bigger. Totalling a whopping 292 pages, this issue is the largest video game magazine ever published in this country!

Players thought that the idea of having free game related inserts was a good deal, so this issue there are even more. We hope you will like the Tradewest poster, Sonic comic book and Electronic Arts mini-mag.

Hopefully you will agree that the new EGM looks a lot cleaner, and reads much better. We have added staff to make sure that you get the best magazine possible.

We're now placing added emphasis on our loyal subscribers. Not only do sub copies now go out via quick second class mail (insuring delivery long before EGM appears on newsstands), this issue represents a visible difference between the newsstand copies and those being delivered to your home. Subscribers will not only save money, but also receive extra special bonus items that won't be included in the issues that you buy in stores. A word of warning to the subscribers, don't open the magazine too close to your face! There is a special treat between pages 130 and 131!

Although EGM is very different, there are some things that won't be changing. You're guaranteed to get the most up-to-date information, news, and tricks found anywhere in the country. For example, check out our new Street Fighter 2, character vs. same color character trick. It works with all 8 warriors! Our Next Wave and International sections show off games you won't be playing until 1993! The Fact File articles give you the details on the very latest game software, and last but not least there is the often imitated but never duplicated Review Crew, bringing you only honest ratings for the current carts.

Just as video games have evolved from 8-Bit to 16-Bit and now to CD, magazines must also evolve to best suit the changing needs of the new style of game player. We hope you like the new EGM, and if you get a free moment, drop us a note to tell us what you think of the new format. We'd love to hear from you!

42,Playing Fair,"
Over the past few months there have been a few rather disturbing press announcements coming out of the offices of some of the major players in the video game industry. The main issue centers around Sega's launching of their new CD-ROM player.

Without a doubt the Sega-CD is a spectacular unit. The technology behind the system is amazing, and this system clearly represents the future of video gaming. We've been talking about it ever since we saw it when it was debuted at the Tokyo Toy Show back in June 1991, and now that the unit is in the stores, the feedback from our readers is very positive for both the Sega-CD and the technology. It's no surprise that the systems are on back order and shortages are appearing already.

And now the problem. It actually dates back to January 1992. At the Winter CES Sega started to show their CD-ROM behind closed doors to the press. Nintendo had nothing to show. On the last day of the show, a press release came out from Nintendo with specifications that implied that their CD-ROM would be better than Sega's, and that it would be out in January 1993. Then came the Summer CES. Sega had their unit on the floor and Nintendo had nothing to show. A short time later, Nintendo issues another press release saying that a 16-Bit CD-ROM machine is inadequate and they are changing theirs to a 32-Bit machine. Another two month pass and Sega holds a special press reception to roll out their U.S. Sega-CD. Two days before the press reception, Nintendo issues another press release stating that they are teaming up with Sony to create an international standard fort CD-ROM technology

Talk about Sega bashing. What is ironic about Nintendo's paper trail' is the memo which didn't come from them. Only one month after the great Ninten-do/Sony team was announced, Sony of Japan quietly announced to the Japanese press that the Nintendo CD machine may not be quite the one they are interested in.

To give Nintendo the benefit of the doubt, perhaps the timing of their string of vaporware memos just coincidentally matched up with Sega's major CD announcements. Nevertheless, I am getting the impression that Nintendo is really going out of their way to do what they can to diminish the impact of the rollout of the Sega CD.

To that I wish Nintendo would play fair, and let Sega have their just rewards. Instead of making constant promises which aren't coming true, Nintendo should just concentrate on making their CD-ROM. Forget that Sega beat you to the CD arena. Remember that you were late with your 16-Bit system and you caught up in only one year. You could, with the help of your long list of excellent licensees, catch up in the CD system war in the same amount of time.

43,Technology At What Price?,"
When is a game system no longer a toy? After all, we are really in the toy business, and it just happens to be that at the present time, video games make up the major percentage of that industry. Most people relate toys with price. Try to sell an item above a certain price point and the toy' just sits on the shelves. In video games, that upper price is about $200 for systems and $80 for cartridges and accessories. With our current 16-Bit game systems and softs well under those thresholds, it isn't too much of a surprise that they are selling like hotcakes. For those systems over $200, like the Neo-Geo, well, they aren't selling quite as fast. This is one reason why Nintendo hopes to sell their 32-Bit CD-ROM peripheral to the consumer for under $200. And, that is also why Sega is in the process of consolidating the circuitry to reduce the manufacturing costs (and the ultimate consumer price) of their Sega CD. There are exceptions that work for a while. The Sega CD and Turbo Duo retail for more than $200, but they include freebies' with their system. These extra games packed with the CD-ROMs give the purchaser a perceived value' that is under the $200 limit. And these systems are selling quite well.

Now, there is a new system coming to the market. Last month I had the privilege of getting an advanced look at the super-secret, CD-ROM only, game machine. Called the 3-D-O, it is perhaps the most technologically advanced game system ever created. That is, if you can even call it a game system. It goes way beyond existing and proposed video game technology, and it is an example of the type of system we will be playing games on in the future. The best news is that it is projected to be in the stores as early as this fall! There is only one catch. Like any new state-of-the-art technology, it will not be cheap. In my interview with Trip Hawkins, president and CEO of 3-D-O, he stated that this system will retail for about $700! He also mentioned that the cost could drop to about $500 after the system has been on the market for a while, but looking at it from the average' player's point of view, that still is a lot of money, with or without pack-in freebies. So, according to the $200 toy rule, the 3-D-O doesn't have a chance. But then, is it a toy?

The 3-D-O is designed to have expansion in mind. So were the game systems but because of their bare-bones CPU and memory, the Super NES and Genesis would choke and bog down if real broadcast-quality full motion video was fed through their meager CPU. Not so with the 3-D-O. Also, with Time Warner (as in 7 million cable TV subscribers) behind this system, Trip hinted that this box does have additional uses beyond just playing games. The 3-D-O, with an optional module and tied into the new fiber optic, thousand channel cable TV network, just could be sitting on top of your TV in the not too distant future!

A toy, the 3-D-O certainly isn't. What instead we might be seeing later this year when it comes out, is the future of video games.

44,Nintendo or Sega Who Is Number One?,"
We're back from CES and like always, it was a great show. There were tons of new games and a lot of new technology. As usual, it's all here in this issue along with the first info, specs and pictures.

But this year, there is something new. The 16-Bit wars that started a year ago September, when Nintendo brought out their Super NES, may just have a new leader. It all depends on whose numbers you believe. Nintendo claims they sold 6.6 million Super NES systems last year. They say that they have 69% of the 16-Bit market with a total of 8.7 million systems in our homes. Sega maintains they sold 4.5 million system in 1992 and have an installed base of 7.5 million systems. Each company says that they are in first place. Who do you believe?

Nintendo did have a great year. They, and their licensees, were able to bring out a constant stream of great games to convince players that the Super NES is the system to buy. Sega, on the other hand, took a pass on the first 8 months and concentrated on selling their games and systems during the Christmas sea-son. Was this wise? Probably not, as Nintendo, by working hard all year long, was able to catch up with, and probably pass, Sega.

Has Sega learned anything from this? Judging from what we saw at the Winter CES, they haven't. Their Menacer light gun won't have a new game for at least another 6 months. Their spectacular Activator allows players to lift their legs and arms to play tunes. Their hot CD system needs new games. From their production list, the CES games either: weren't there (Sonic, Dolphin, Sherlock Holmes 2), unplayable (Joe Montana, Citizen-X, Silpheed, Dark Wizard), or cartridge games with CD tunes (Spiderman, After Burner 3, Indiana Jones, Final Fight). Not too impressive considering Sega was bragging about their great jillion dollar multi-media CD studio they built last year.

What does Sega say about this? The same thing they said last year: Wait until Summer CES. But, will the dealers and players wait? The NES is dead. This will be the year that players move up to a 16-Bit system. Nintendo projects that their Super NES system sales this year could approach the all-time yearly single-platform record! That is 8 million new Super NES systems. About seventy-five percent of these will be sold during the Christmas season. That leaves two million systems to be sold from January through September. These two million players will look at the new games on the shelves and see a lot of exciting titles for the Super NES. Will they be as impressed with the new Genesis titles? Perhaps not, as they would have to wait until fall when the Summer CES games get to the stores. Which system will they then buy?

History seems to be repeating itself. A few years ago Sega had a great 8-Bit system (Master System). It was clearly superior to the NES. Nintendo persevered though, and with a lot of hard work, they made the NES a household item.

Nintendo is now back with their 16-Bit system. In a little bit over a year they have gone from nothing to at least tied for first place. And knowing this, Sega, can you really afford to make the game players wait until Summer CES?

45,The Best of the Show Was There a Winner?,"
If you were to ask a dozen people who were at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show what the game of the show was, almost everybody will, think for a while, and then say Nintendo's FX chip game StarFox. I know this for a fact, as many of our own editors have said just that.

Well, they all are wrong.

Granted StarFox is new and revolutionary, and plays and looks great, but it just wasn't so good that it could be called the Game of the Show. One reason why it stands out in everybody's minds is that Nintendo knows how to hype up a game. They don't just put a few carts out for people to play, they think big. So big in fact, that they built a whole geodesic dome around their StarFox display. It was hard not to think of that game while at the show.

Then what was the best of the show? It was an obscure Sega CD title called Silpheed. You see Sega doesn't like to brag about their games. In fact they did everything possible not to call attention to that game.

First, they knew ahead of time that Nintendo would be hyping up their polygon graphics game. So they decided to take theirs and hide it, by putting it in the middle of a bunch of their other CD games. There was no need to run a Silpheed/StarFox side-by side comparison as they once did with Sonic and Mario.

Next, in case if anybody would accidentally see their revolutionary game, they decided to have a 20% unplayable version in the machine. There was no reason to show the nearly complete version that was on display at Sega Fair in Tokyo in December.

Finally, to keep the game completely secret, Sega decided not to mention it in their press kit. There was no need to tell the world that Silpheed had over 500,000 polygons on the planet level alone; that Silpheed moved along at 20 frames per second; that Silpheed uses advanced fractal geometry to calculate the texture mapped highlights and shadows of the detailed geographical fea-tures; that Silpheed had pounding music and sound effects, all encoded in stereo, surround, PCM, CD quality sound.

Sorry, Sega. But I just couldn't keep it a secret anymore. Silpheed was the real Game of the Show. If you doubt it, check out the pictures on page 52.

Forget FX chip technology. CD is where the action is, and Nintendo's unit is at least another year away. Sega has it now.

But don't tell anybody, as Sega wants to keep it a secret.

46,We're Sorry For Being Honest,"
Last week I got my first experience at being on the road. I flew out for the Sega/Capcom press conference that unveiled the unsecret' Street Fighter 2 CE. After the conference I called up some of the companies in the San Francisco area to stop by for a visit.

After the normal social greetings, the subject always got around to one common subjectgame reviews. Why did our game only get a 4? was the standard question. Unfortunately, the answer was the same also. The game only deserved a 4. While not the first time I had to answer for a low review, as phone calls come in every week about items published in our maga-zines, but telling it to people face to face is something different. It's not an easy thing to say to a product manager sitting across the table, who has probably hundreds, if not thousands of hours, and an equal amount of money invested in making a game. It is doubly tough because companies know that a low number review will mean smaller sales in the stores, not only from fewer players buying the games, but also from smaller initial purchases from the larger retail chains.

We happen to be the major source of information for many of the video game buyers. They take our reviews into consideration when they make their nationwide purchases. It is quite a responsibility but in the goals that Steve set years ago, our reviews will always represent our honest, unbiased opinions of the games. This attitude also carries through all of the sections in the magazine.

While other magazines may have a more upbeat attitude, and every game gets smiling faces, that type of facade is easy to see through and players start to ignore the ratings and quickly lose faith in the integrity of the magazine. The same attitude goes towards the editorial. I could play it safe and just tell you what is in this issue. But that just repeats the table of contents. Rather you will see opinions about the industry here. Sure I get a lot of angry calls and letters from the companies and readers about anything negative that I wrote regarding a particular system or game, but these editorials aren't just random thoughts from someone new to the industry. I'm one of the old timers, having been to over 25 Consumer Electronics Shows, and dozens of Japanese and European trade shows. After a while it isn't too hard to be able to read between the lines to see what a company is really saying or doing.

Most importantly, many of the editorials represent what our readers are say-ing. I read each and every letter that you send in, and you, the readers do have a voice in the industry. If we get a thousand letters from Super NES players who are worried that the mighty Nintendo may take out the blood and fatalities in Mortal Kombat (as we have) that message will be passed on to the powers that be at Nintendo. It may not make a difference to the Big N, but we are here to get the message to them. So keep your letters coming in. It does make a difference!

Don't just stop there, though. We are starting to offer more controversial subjects in our letters column. Let us know your opinion. And finally, take a moment to let us know what you think of the magazine. We are constantly evolving, and with your input, the biggest and best will stay on top.

47,Capcom Smart! Very Smart!,"
When you hear the name Capcom the first thing that probably comes to mind is Street Fighter 2. Face it, SF2 is the Pac-Man of the '90's and Capcom is making the most of it. Any time a game sells in the millions, we're dealing with serious coins. And that is not even counting the jillions of dollars coming in for the licensing rights and royalties from letting others use the characters. Buy a pair of SF2 underwear and a few cents goes to Capcom.

There is nothing wrong or secret about this, that's big business in the big city. If it isn't SF2, it's TMNT, or Bart Simpson or hundreds of other popular characters. In fact, we have to compliment Capcom on the excellent job they are doing in keeping the SF2 theme alive and thriving.

You can still find good and bad, however, in every deal. The story starts with Capcom becoming a licensee of Sega. As a result of SF2's influence on 16-Bit Nintendo sales, it's understandable that Capcom of Japan and the Big N are close. That game alone pushed the Super NES ahead of the Genesis in terms of total system sales last summer. Now, SF2 CE, which is the version that all serious SF2 players have been waiting for, is coming out on Genesis. It couldn't have been a pretty sight in the board room when Nintendo heard this. This version could start a rash for new Genesis systems sales and give Sega the lead again.

From a business standpoint, Capcom is again maximizing its expo-sure. Bringing SF2 CE out on the Super NES would hardly have made as big an impact as if it appeared on a whole new system.

Back on the Japanese home front, however, Nintendo certainly isn't happy. So Capcom of Japan tells Nintendo that they will bring the Turbo SF2 CE to Nintendo's 16-Bit system and quickly issues a very untimely (for Sega) press release and screen shots of the new game. Nintendo sees big dollar signs and Capcom of Japan is back on good terms with the Mario Men. So is everybody happy? Not quite.

There just happens to be the minor detail about the deal between Capcom and Sega that evidently slipped Capcom's mind. Instead of walking to the bank while millions of gamers worldwide head for Sega and then switch gears again to seek out the Nintendo for the latest SF2 update, Capcom has shot a flare high into the sky telling gamers around the world to wait for the better version later in the year.

Who wins? Definitely Capcom as they can sell millions of SF2 CE on Genesis and millions more of Turbo SF2 CE on Nintendo. Even Nintendo wins, as they have the number one SF2 game that will help sell systems during the holidays. As for Sega they at least have a new licensee.

48,The Beat Goes On,"
Occasionally I like to jump into this column to give everyone a sense of where I see this industry going and update you on the state of the magazine from a perspective that I uniquely enjoy. While big Ed readies himself for the CES and a date with destiny (our main man ties the big knot this month), he's left this page of the mag open for me to fill. It's about four in the morning, so if I start to ramble on or become incoherent just be patient and rest assured that it will come to an end.

Since I started this magazine nearly five not-so-long years ago, both myself and the publication have met with a variety of obstacles and challenges on our way toward becoming the premiere voice for the video game enthusiast. While it has all been a barrel of fun, there are some things that consistently tried to block our ability to bring you the best and most accurate info on new games and game developments before anyone else.

While EGM was started with the best intentions, many things, including competitors and game companies have tried to make our road to success as bumpy as possible. EGM has always managed to bounce back, however, because of the loyal support of readers like you who helped us through the rough times when we were getting started and stuck by us when we weren't the mammoth mag you now hold. We also appreciate the new readers who realize that EGM has the best first. Why else would you read a magazine about video games?

Another important element integral to EGM's growth has been my incredible partnership and friendship with Jeffrey Eisenberg, the T-1000 of advertising sales people. Jeff, along with his corps of Terminators (namely Brandon, Chad and Suzanne), has played an important role in making sure EGM is always better than the other guy.

Speaking of the other guy, I'd also like to extend a special thank-you to Andy, Pat, and Mike for making me work harder, care more, and generally have a better attitude about being number one. I don't know what I'd do without you!

That brings us up to the present and a future I find filled with great excitement. The selection of games and game systems is now destined to grow, giving you even more choices and ultimately better titles to choose from. EGM will continue to expand and change as well, heading into our sixth year and our 50th issue (September). Keep your eyes peeled for our annual upgrade in October and brace yourself for a look that's totally unlike anything you've seen before! Don't forget about Hero Illustrated either, the hot new mag from the people that bring you this mag. We're already selling over 250,000 copies every month! Be sure to check it out and see what all the excitement is about!

In closing, let me say thank you for your continued support of EGM and the idea behind the magazine. While the rest of our peers take their shots, we let the bullets bounce off and concentrate on what's important: giving you the best info, pictures and package you can find! The beat goes on

49,Christmas 1993 And Beyond,"
One nice thing about the Summer Consumer Electronics Show is that we get to see what games will be coming out during the all-important Christmas shopping season, and based on what was at the show, all of our editors agreed that this is going to be the best holiday season ever. And since both Sega and Nintendo are predicting record years for game system sales, each is bringing out their big software guns to convince players that their system is the one to buy. It is almost as if both Sega and Nintendo knew what each other was doing, for they are matching each other one for one in all the major categories. For example, with Sonic a predictable year-end superstar, Mario is now coming back in a whole new adventure for the U.S. Super NES players. Sega's ultrafast Virtua Racing (with their new DSP chip) for the Genesis will go head to head with Nintendo's second generation FX chip gameFX Trax.

Even the licensees will be going at each other. The last in Capcom's line of Street Fighter carts will be going up against Acclaim's long-awaited Mortal Kombat. Throw in Sega's Eternal Champions, Konami's new Turtles Tournament Fighter and Interplay's Clay Fighter, and even the hard-core players will finally say enough already' to the street fighting genre. The one good thing about the proliferation of SF games is that with so much competition, prices aren't going to be outrageously high. Capcom already has announced a $69 list price for both their Genesis 24-Meg and Super NES 20-Meg Turbo Street Fighter 2 carts.

The games for 1994 are looking even more spectacular. I had the privilege of meeting with many of the Japanese game companies right after attending the Tokyo Toy Show and what they have in store for us next year is truly spectacular. After playing games like Sonic CD, Virtua Racing and some yet unnamed new polygon graphics CDs, the next generation of games will make this year's hits look old. Virtual Reality is on its way to the home, as are games on demand via cable. Artificial Intelligence (Al) in games is improving geometrically. If you thought the computer was wimpy and easy to beat in the old Super NES SF2, wait until you see all of the random combos and cheap moves the wizards at Capcom have programmed into the new Turbo SF2! Likewise, Sega has promised a level of Al that constantly adjusts its game play based on how well you are doing. The days of predictable and dumb' enemy movements are rapidly on their way out.

Although the games are a ways away, the information about them is at your fingertips as we have brought it all back from the CES and Tokyo Toy Show. We have been able to get hands-on tests on hundreds of new games, peripherals and systems, and they are all packed into this great issue. We hope you will enjoy reading about them as much as we did trying them out and evaluating them. As always, keep your letters coming and get ready for October!

Gotta run. I'm late for a meeting with a preacher.

50,"Nintendo Wins, Acclaim Loses!","
It probably comes as no surprise to anyone that none of the graphic violence, gore, and blood found in the arcade version of Mortal Kombat found its way into the Super NES version of the game.

After getting all four versions from Acclaim, the first thing our editors did was look to see how much Acclaim had to change to get their games approved by Sega and Nintendo. At one work station you could hear the all right' while on the other side of the room the words were a lot harsher (mostly unfit to print) when they saw how lame most of the finishing moves ended up. It shouldn't be too difficult to guess that Nintendo is playing God again. On the other hand, Sega allowed the cart to be programmed exactly as the arcade version but it will have an MA-13 rating on the game box.

How bad is the Super NES version? Real bad if you are looking for an arcade clone. For example, Sub-Zero now freezes his opponent and the loser shatters into ice cubes! That's sure a far cry from pulling the opponent's head and spine off the body. Most of the other finishing moves are equally as bad.

All of this, of course, has been done to preserve Nintendo's pristine reputation of presenting only wholesome games to its audience. But sorry Nintendo, you can turn the blood into sweat, modify the fatalities, and change a few words in the instruction book, but the bottom line is that no matter how much you sanitize' the game, it still involves people killing people, some of them women. And I bet there isn't an 8-year-old in the country that doesn't know the real premise behind this game. Also, come around Christmas time there will be a lot of unsuspecting moms buying this cart for their kids and I'm sure they will have a different impression of the Nintendo Seal of Approval once they hear Johnny yelling Kill him! as he puts the finishing move to his opponent. The fact is that the big N can order the game on the screen changed but the plot is still very real to the players. So what have you accomplished Ninten-do? Not a lot, other than make everybody unhappy. The players are upset that they didn't get the real' game and the parents won't like the half-hearted changes.

But this is Nintendo. You play by their rules, or not at all. So what is the player to do to show the starched collars at the Big N that they are upset? You could buy the Genesis version to get the real thing, but Nintendo won't care as they already received their money from the game. You could write more letters but they didn't respond to the first write-in campaign. You could switch to the Genesis but then you'll be missing out on all the games that you bought the Super NES for in the first place. Actually when you consider the options, there is nothing you can do, and Nintendo knows it. Any other ideas? Send in your thoughts and we'll devote a couple of the Interface columns to the issue.

On a lighter side, as you page through this issue, you may notice a change in some of our Fact Files. We have been able to improve the quality of the photos that appear in the mag and, by the next issue, all of the pix should be the very best pos-sible. But this is only the beginning. As I write this, Steve is busy at work putting the finishing touches on the redesign of the book and we think you'll be pleasantly surprised at what we have in store for you. Check it out next issue.

The president of Nintendo of Japan announced at the Shoshinkai Nintendo Show that they will be bringing out a new 64-Bit game machine. This system, he said, would be the ultimate video game con-sole. And that it would. With specs like 100 MHz clock speed and HDTV compatibility, their Project Reality' would exceed anything ever dreamed possible. The best news would be the price tagonly about $250! After the ohhs and ahhs from the audience subsided (including myself, reality set in. I said to our people at the show, Wait a minute, this is just Nintendo talking again.' I seem to remember other past promises of theirs, such as a deal with Sony to create a new standard of CD-ROM entertainment (Play Station); a deal with Phillips which would link the Super NES with their CD-I system; a promise to make a CD-ROM drive that would hook up to the Super NES; and just a few months ago, I seem to recall Nintendo stating that their CD-ROM machine would be 32-Bit as the current 16-Bit CD machines were not capable of delivering true multimedia entertainment. That's a lot of promises, especially when none of them ever became reality.

Well Nintendo, there is an old expression about a boy crying wolf once too often. Especially when each one of your announcements just happens to coincide with a major competitor's product roll-out (3DO this time). Do you really expect people to believe your latest press release? Not only do you want players to wait until the end of 1995, but do you really think that you can shrink a $100,000 Silicon Graphics workstation down into a $250 Super-Ultra-Hyper NES? Perhaps you can pull this one off, but I for one don't believe it will see the light of day (like all of your other promised machines), and furthermore, I am not going to stand around waiting 2 1/2 years to see if you are right. With the Sega CD starting to come of age, the 3DO only days away from appearing in the stores, and even more fascinating virtual reality devices already in the prototype stages, why should I hang on to my Super NES and be content with Yoshi 6 and Super FX Tetris 5? Next year you'll probably announce a new 256-Bit $199 holodeck attachment anyway (to coincide with Sega's 32-Bit system press conference.

In other news, as you can see, EGM has just undergone a major update. Besides the typical background, graphics and logo changes you are seeing everywhere, EGM will be more interactive with the read-er. That means more contests, information, news, and articles. All in the EGM style (which will get even bolder) that goes beyond just retyping press releases. Unfortunately we couldn't get it all in this issue, so stay tuned as next issue is looking even hotter!

52,Too Many Choices!,"
If a new game system is the main item on your Christmas wish list, be prepared for a rude awakening when you start your shopping. If you thought this was as simple as choosing between the Super Nintendo or the Genesis, brace yourself. This season there are no less than 19 systems to choose from (even more if you want to have the Japanese versions of the U.S. machines)! Sounds scary, doesn't it?

Well, OK, before you jump all over me claiming gross exaggeration, the list does include the portables and the relics like the NES and Master System which no respectable gamer would ever want now, but the list is still longer than you would expect.

Need some help in wading through the systems? Let me run through the list in order of personal preference.

On the bottom of the list is a console version of the FM Towns called the Marty. Besides being very expensive, don't expect to see it or its games at your local Toys R Us. With no national distribution, this puppy died on the boat from Japan to the United States.

Here's one system you probably haven't thought of, but if you wander through your local Radio Shack store, you will run across their VIS (Video Information System). The distribution is there but the games are horrible.

Pioneer is now in the game business with their LaserActive CD system. Coming in at a huge price-$1,570 (if you want both the Sega CD and T.T.I. Duo modules) and a small number of $120 games, this system has a long way to go before it becomes a household world. Great for karaoke, though!

CD-I is Phillips' entry in the game' market. Even though it has been in the stores for some time now, it hasn't caught on as the games just don't cut it. One kind of wonders how desperate they are when one of their new releases (with video inserts) is the popular bookThe Joy of Sex.

Commodore is back and their new console system is the Amiga CD*. This one could be a contender and is worth watching. The games are good and the $400 price is within reason.

TTI is still hanging in there with their Duo. The number of new games this season is way down and they are going to have to work real hard to get back in the players' interest.

SNK's home arcade machine, NEOGEO, is becoming a worthy investment if you like fighting games. Come on guys, how about something new?

Atari has made a big splash with its $200 Jaguar. Their first games are okay, but will they get the big name' third-party developers that are needed in order to turn it into a major contender?

3DO is the premier new system. If you can swallow the heavy start-up price it just might be worth the price of admission. The first batch of games are good but not great. Needs time to mature.

Sega comes in on top with its Sega CD. Though it started out poorly, Sonic CD and the upcoming AX 101 and Midnight Serenade could pull it out of its slump. But next year's 32-Bit Saturn (in Japan) may cause some players to wait for their whole new system.

What's left? The big two of course-Genesis and Super Nintendo! Somehow I bet you knew what would be the systems to buy this year. For our opinions on which of these two is the best though, don't miss our 1994 Video Game Buyer's Guide coming out next month. Have fun shopping!

53,Sega vs. Nintendo The Battle At The Next Level Begins!,"
The battle lines are drawn, the swords are raised, and the two video game giants are already at war a war of words, that is. The stakes are huge as the future of video games is on the line. The problem is whether the public will accept the next generation of high priced 32-/64-Bit video game machines. Everybody in the industry is very aware of the crash of 1984, and when Nintendo launched their Super NES a couple of years ago, the companies waited and worried. If the players decided that they wouldn't pay the couple of hundred bucks to move up from their NES to the Super NES, there would have been problems. Now the NES is just a part of video game history, but with the dawn of mega-buck CD game machines like the 3DO and LaserActive already here, the problem is back. This time the cost of a new machine is much greater, the software just isn't that spectacular, and the players aren't all that excited with what they see. Anyway, the CD machine image is already tarnished as the Sega CD hasn't really set the world on fire.

To make it worse, the big names are starting to play mind games with the players. 3DO started the ball rolling with a 32-Bit machine. Atari upped the ante with their 64-Bit Jaguar and Sega followed with their 32-Bit Saturn. Nintendo overturned the applecart with their 64-Bit Silicon Graphics Project Reality machine and Sega was suddenly stuck in the middle with only a 32-Bit machine. They countered with a new press release stating that they are adding a 64-Bit video chip to their machine. Sony now is stating that their new 32-Bit machine will go beyond the 64-Bit class systems under development by Nintendo or Sega. All of a sudden Bits are all that matter and bigger is better.

Confusing? Very! Although there are a dozen different hardware companies in this new CD machine war, when you throw out the small players, it will still boil down to a Nintendo and Sega battle. Of these two companies, Sega has the larger problem. Nintendo is really hyping up their SG machine. Sega is doing nothing. Nintendo is sticking to a $250 price, Sega of Japan can match that, but without a CD-ROM. With it, the price soars to about $460. What's interesting is that even though Nintendo doesn't have a CD machine, they really haven't been hurt by letting Sega tinker with a couple of so-so CD games. Sega, on the other hand, has to promote and sell their existing CD-ROM system for two more Christmases. Then there are the rumors. Like the Saturn not being downwardly compatible with the Genesis or Sega CD. Or Sega of Japan ceasing all new CD work in favor of Saturn. Sure seems kind of tough to convince kids to buy a Sega CD.

There's a simple solution Sega. Give us the lowdown on Saturn now, start promoting it by having it at Winter CES, bring it out next fall instead of 1995, make sure that Sonic the Arcade Game (not Virtua Fighters) is the pack-in, and sell it for $279 (make the CD optional). That package will sell!

54,Violence in Video Games Part 2!,"
Video game violence is in the news again. This time, though, the concern is being voiced from one of the highest levels of government-the Attorney General of the State of California. Government brings shivers down my spine. We all know what happens when government tries to correct somethingit either doesn't work, gets bogged down in red tape or legislation, or goes to such extremes that nobody is happy.

On November 16, Dan Lungren, the Attorney General of the State of California, held a press conference in Los Angeles that, in part, raised serious concerns about the shocking and obscene display of graphic, gratuitous violence [in video games]. Of course, the game in question was the Sega version of Acclaim's Mortal Kombat. Sega's Night Trap CD was also cited as another bad game. While he emphasized that he wasn't proposing censorship or mandatory government action, he did send letters to industry leaders (Nintendo, Sega, Capcom, Acclaim, Hasbro [whom he must believe is responsible for Night Trap], and also to seven retailers who sell video games.) appealing to [their] sense of corporate and personal responsibility. He goes on to say that, unlike violent movies or suggestive music lyrics, which are passive forms of entertainment,  video games require the player's total involve-ment. Statistics are cited to back up his statement and he concludes with: We are deluding ourselves if we continue to deny any connection between the rise in violence on our streets and among our youth, and the daily bombardment of our youth with violent images in sports, movies, music, television and video games.

Quite a statement! I'm not going to repeat my comments on violence that I detailed in my September editorial, as I still believe in having the freedom of choice. But, there is much more involved than just damning Nintendo for not giving us the choice of what is in a game, and praising Sega for letting us decide what is good or bad.

After thinking about violence for a few months, a good analogy is the movie industry. Nintendo is the Disney of our industry. They only make G or PG games. That's it, period. Sega, being more liberal, is like any of the other studios who make movies with G or R ratings.

Nintendo's role is very clear. They have a standard and if you want to put out a game on their system you will do it to their specifications, which are squeaky clean G or PG games.

Sega, on the other hand, publishes games that could contain video graphics that may not be suitable for all audiences. They have a rating system. That I believe is good, but it is not work-ing. If it was, Mr. Lungren wouldn't be complaining. Why isn't it working? Simple. Sega has not done enough to educate the public. Case in point: every movie ad, either TV or print, has to show the rating. Sega, you might want to force your licensees to do the same but also remember to do it yourself. Start the ball rolling by putting the ratings on all your ads. Page through this mag. How many times do you see a rating on an ad? Not very often. Also, spend some money and take out ads that explain your ratings. Use your publication Sega Visions as the media if need be. But don't just do it once and forget about it. Explain the ratings in every issue. Mom and Pop either haven't a clue as to what they mean, don't know that they exist, or don't know why the game got the rating. While you have some literature that Scholastic did on the ratings and an 800 parents hotline number (1-800-379 KIDS), the public apparently doesn't know about it, as our Letter of the Month points out. Having the ratings is half way to the solu-tion, now develop the consumer awareness and confidence in what you did. The first thing a mom asks about a movie is What's the rating? Get it to the point where she says the same thing about a video game. If you don't, then guys like Mr. Lungren will do it for you. And none of us want to see that happen. Remember, he's the government and we all know what happens if he is forced to step in and fix the problem.

Tell you what Sega. I am going to make it a little easier on you, and I call on all my colleagues at the other video game magazines to do the same. Starting with this issue, every time we review a game we will publish your rating in our review. Also, send me your detailed guidelines and I will devote whatever space it takes to educate the public.

While the majority of attention is on Sega, every hardware and software manufacturer in this industry should think about this. With advanced systems like 3DO, Jaguar and LaserActive able to reproduce true video in a game, very little can be left to the imagination. It's just a matter of time before these games and companies are in the spotlight.

Is Mr. Lungren just blowing off steam, looking for a safe' reelection topic, or does he really have a point? Let me know and we'll devote a whole Letters section to your replies.

55,The Winners and Losers of Censorship,"
I caught the replay of the Senate Hearings on video game violence last night on C-SPAN. Even though it kept me up to three in the morning, I found this brief peek at how many groups view video game play to be most enlightening. While the majority of the speakers, including congressmen Kohl and Lieberman, managed to use the very descriptive forms of violence found exclusively in Night Trap and Mortal Kombat to lobby that all games should be judged the same.

While Nintendo put its best marketing muscle forward to describe the virtues of their approval process which, they claim, eliminates overt levels of violence in Super NES titles (except, of course, the 20,000 deaths that take place in a typical game of Smash TV) it wasn't until Sega representative Bill White explained, in essence, that any form of media, if taken out of context, could be make the whole medium look badwhether it's video games, television, music or movies.

I couldn't agree more.

While you have to applaud both sides for their individual stance on the issue of video game violence, and I personally agree that high levels of violence can't contribute positively to very young minds in any way, it shouldn't be the responsibility of government to form committees and spend money to tell game players what is and isn't permissible. Do the death sequences employed by Mortal Kombat have a stronger impact that the thousands of deaths that take place in Smash TV? Does that mean that video game terminations are permissable if conducted in low-res? If you're at the controls of a flight simulator and you go for a soda, subsequently causing the deaths of all 240 passengers on-board, will the government say that game should be played only by adults? Come to think of it, should Nintendo recall Super Mario World because it promotes the incineration of turtles? If PETA only knew.

I realize that I'm arguing a point to absurdity and that for most of us the questions surrounding video game violence are not quite this exaggerated. Night Trap shouldn't be viewed by younger players (even though they'd probably think it was cool), but that's why Sega put a rating on the front. Others will argue that the ratings do little to keep youngsters from playing the game, but since Night Trap, Mortal Kombat and most other titles cost slightly more than what your average 10 year-old has in pocket change, the purchasers of these products should exercise more caution when buying them. We can argue the definition of violence as it applies to video games, but at least Sega took the initiative to at least provide some information to parents and others making these purchases.

And it's with the companies that this issue should be debated, not in Senate chambers with congressmen who's only knowledge of the subject is gathered by their aides. For although the video game industry was given an opportunity to speak, the decisions related to video game violence and the government's role in the subject were made in Mr. Kohl's and Mr. Lieberman's minds way before C-SPAN got there.

56,Sega Sets The Pace for 1994!,"
This is going to be a very good year for Sega. Why? Because they dominated the Winter CES! Not only did they have a whole slew of great games ready for the first six months of the year, but they also were talking about a lot of great projects they have in store for the future like Saturn, modular cartridges and a whole new generation of CD software. And their archival Nintendo? Promises, promises and more promises. I have to give the Big N credit, though-Super Metroid was the game of the show, but beyond that, Nintendo really didn't have much that was really exceptional.

Here's my read on the ongoing Sega vs. Nintendo battle that continued at this CES:

New machines: Sega's Saturn wasn't at the show. Sega did run a video tape that talked about Saturn and showed a few of the work-in-progress game screens. What we could see were near-perfect arcade clones of Daytona, Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighters. It looked very impressive! Nintendo had monitors set up that ran demonstrations of unbelievably realistic 3-D polygon scenes. They easily blew away what Sega was showing. The only problem was that these images were being generated by a jillion dollar CG work station underneath the table skirts (see pix in Interface column). Oops!

Systems sold to date: There has always been an ongoing battle between Nintendo and Sega as to who was number one. Each company would publish different numbers and there was no way to find out who was correct. That was, until now. There is a tracking service called TRSTS (Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service) and they provide a nationwide unbiased accounting of sales in the video game industry. During the all-important Christmas shopping month of November, TRSTS reports that Sega sold 63 percent of all the 16-Bit video game systems.

Consumer Friendliness: For lack of a better name, Sega is aware that games are getting very expensive. Now that FX and SVP chips are being added to carts, 16-Bit games will soon approach the $100 mark. Sega is doing something about it. It's all very simple; sell a mini-cart with the SVP chip on it and the new games on plug-in boards. Smart, very smart. Not only for the consumer, but also for the third-party licensees who don't have to raise the game costs to cover the special chips. Taking notes Nintendo?

There's more, like the game ratings. Looks like Sega read my January editorial about making their game ratings more visible. And boy were they! Every game at CES and each piece of literature had their game rating prominently displayed. Good job, Sega. Now if only we can get the other game mags to do the same.

Now, about Saturn? How about showing it at June CES and bringing it out in November?

57,Video Game Systems Are Just Expensive Toys,"
A couple of days ago Nintendo announced that their Project Reality game system would be a cartridge-only machine. Hardly a big surprise, as nobody, not even Nintendo, would have the ability to bring out new hardware with a CD-ROM drive at an introductory price of around $250. What's really important about this announcement, though, is something much more basic. It's the fact that video games are a part of the toy industry, and that for an item to be a mass market success, there are certain limits as to how much people are willing to pay for a toy. In this economy anything over $250 becomes an item that is thought about before it is purchased. Yes, Nintendo could have easily planned on bringing out a $450 CD and cart machine, but it just wouldn't sell in the quantity that Nintendo would want to see. That makes it hard for companies to bring out new technology. The way these companies get around this $250 maximum price is to break the hardware into several independent pieces, each one less than $250.

Witness the Sega Genesis and the add-on Sega CD. Put them together in one shell (Wondermega, or X-Eye here in the States) and the $450 system just doesn't sell. Sold separately, the public was quick to accept the new two piece system with open arms. Another good example is the Atari Jaguar. Since it is selling for only $250, this toy' is doing well. Their CD, set to debut for under $200, should also meet little resistance from game players.

An example of a non-toy' game system is the 3DO. This system is outside of the impulse buying range of the public, and while now it is just starting to move, it hasn't set the world afire as the system to replace Nintendo or Sega. Matsushita of Japan has noted this, and when they roll out their version of the 3DO later this month, it will be launched at a much more palatable $500 price point. The U.S. (it should be noted) will also reduce their price to $500. This is still quite expensive, but 3DO has also stated that the system could hit $400 by this fall.

As to the newer systems, the same toy price guidelines will apply to Saturn and Sony's PS-X. Sega, wanting to stay competitive with Nintendo, is now forced to bring out a cart-only Saturn system. While not officially announced yet, this system is tentatively priced at $275 for the Japanese launch this November. Less is known about Sony's machine, but if it appears as a CD-only system, they could run into the same player resistance the 3D0 did.

The same toy pricing also applies to game cartridges. Once the cost of the cart exceeds the system price, there are problems. Sega just might find this out if they actually release Virtua Racing at $99. Fortunately, Sega will soon come out with a separate SVP modular cart, so the prices of all future SVP games (which will plug into the SVP cart) will be back to affordable. Just think, if Nintendo had implemented this split cart format years ago, perhaps we wouldn't have had to pay full price for each of the (past and future) updates of Street Fighter 2!

58,Sega vs. Nintendo U.S. vs. Japan,"
I see that Sega and Nintendo are back at each other's throats again. What is it this time? The rating system. It is interesting to sit back and watch the two companies fight over the most trivial of things. But there is a more important point to this battle. It is the fact that both companies are about equal in the video game wars and any time either can get one up on the other, it could translate into increased market share. And since each claims to have more systems sold than the other, the battle is very intense. Actually, I have no problem in calling it a tie at least for now. This coming Christmas, there will be a definite leader though, and both companies have already started to set up their holiday season battle plans.

For hardware, Nintendo is putting their bucks behind a Game Boy to Super NES adapter. Not a bad idea, but hardly revolutionary. A couple of years ago when the Game Boy market was much stronger, this would have been an important peripheral. But now, the hot items are 32- and 64-Bit systems, not playing 8-Bit colorized black and white games on a 16-Bit system.

Sega knows this and as we predicted last month, their big Christmas item will be a mini, cart-based, 32-Bit Saturn module called the Genesis 32-X which will plug into the Genesis. Now that is news! Couple that with a price of only $150 and Sega could just unequivocally become the U.S. video game leader going into 1995.

But that's only the U.S. market. This week I'm over in Japan attending a Consumer Software Group trade show and things are very different here. With no game rating system, there is no Sega / Nintendo war. In fact, things are so one-sided that there isn't even a battle. Nintendo is easily number one in both hardware and software sales, and Sega is a distant third. Business is really bad for Sega here. New system sales, despite a $70 Mega Drive price, are almost down to zero, while Nintendo's Super Famicom still commands, and gets, a $140 price, without a cart. Also, there is so little Sega news that several of the all-Sega magazines have gone under due to lack of player interest. Regarding games, the Top 30' charts are all Nintendo games and with Final Fantasy VI coming out this week, Nintendo couldn't be looking better.

But the economy could. Everybody is hurting over here. Games just aren't selling as well as they used to. Super Metroid came out last week and, in better times, would have sold out the very first day. Not only are there tons of carts in the stores, but less than a week after its introduction, the price has been slashed over 30 percent. Both Super Metroid and Sega's Virtua Racing are already selling for under $60. Still, games are a best buy. They haven't changed significantly in price over the years I've been coming here. Everything else has, though. A glass of fresh orange juice at my hotel is $12; a cab ride starts at $6, and even the bare bones McDonald's hamburger is over $2. With prices like that there isn't a lot left for games.

The year-end holiday season will be different too. Sega plans on having the CD-based Saturn in the stores, but it will be competing with the 32-Bit Sony PS-X and the new NEC machine. Here, Nintendo can afford to take a slower pace as all of these new machines combined won't make a dent in their market. Things in Japan are looking very good for Nintendo.

But has being number one for so long built up an over confidence at Nintendo? | would sure hate to be Nintendo's U.S. President when he reports back to Japan why they may be slipping in America.

The war isn't over though, and already we are seeing changes at Nintendo of America. The year is still early and, who knows, perhaps Nintendo just might bring out a surprise this Christmas which will turn things around. One thing's for sure, Nintendo certainly knows how to make good software. Super Metroid is unbelievable! This I can attest towhen my staff tells me to bring 10 copies of Super Metroid back with me, it has to be great! When I asked them if they wanted Virtua Racing, Streets of Rage 3, or Sonic Drift, they said thanks, but no thanks. Oh well, sorry Sega.

59,EGM Selected As Best U.S. Game Magazine at ECTS!,"
We're quite pleased. It's always a great honor to receive any type of recognition, but when it comes from an official organization outside one's own country, it is something really special! The event was the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS), which was held in England in mid-April. This show is the video game and computer show in all of Europe and, to put it in per-spective, this show is the European equivalent of our Consumer Electronics Show and, like ours, is held twice a year. Thanks!

It was a good show. If anything, it was the first real occasion which demonstrated that the video game world is more than just the United States and Japan. Many more games are now being developed in England, France, Germany, and Russia and this is no deep dark secret as virtually all of the major U.S. and Japanese companies had representatives out shopping' for new ideas or licenses from this undiscovered wealth of video game development talent. There certainly was a lot of heavy dealing going on, both on the floor and in the meeting rooms. All of the new hardware was there, assuming you knew where to look and if you had the proper credentials. The Sony PS-X was up and running off-site and the Saturn development system was being shown under nondisclosure. Nintendo had their Game Boy to Super NES adapter playing, and the talk between developers at the bar would have melted a reporter's tape recorder.

It was hard to believe it was London and not the U.S., until buying something. Expensive! Not as bad as Japan, but nowhere near the U.S. Remember the McDonald's cheeseburger discussion from last month? It's over $2 in Tokyo and $1.40 in London. Want to buy a video game? If it costs $50 here it's £50 in London. Not good when you also figure in an exchange rate of about $1.5 to the British pound. Taxes are a major portion of any purchase. There is a 14 percent import duty and a 17 percent tax tacked onto good things like video games or systems. Kind of looks like the good old U.S.A. still has the best deals.

In other news, the countdown has begun to the first issue of EGM2. We're staffed up and the work on the first, and only, biweekly voice of the industry has begun! The big day is July 19. Look for it!

60,The Flood Waters Are Rising,"
With the apparent death of the faithful Nintendo 8-Bit system, it is time to look back at where we've been and forward to where we are headed. The old NES ventured into the U.S. market at a time when most thought electronic gaming was dead. The Atari 2600 and 5200 had done well for a time, with competition coming from Intellivision and ColecoVision. However, with so many choices of hardware and players drowning in poor software, no one was winning the battle-let alone the war. The players had nowhere to turn and the collapse of a mighty video game empire was eminent.

Along comes Nintendo and Sega with new platforms and hardware to clutter stores and confuse consumers with systems and software that most agreed would not do well. Consumers (like myself weren't ready to be drawn back into the video game realm so quickly. But their approach was different. Most games at that time were arcade games that challenged you with skill tests which only ended after you died and/or got tired of playing. Nintendo gave us games that had an objective such as save the princess' or rid the galaxy of evil.' They even had endings after you won the game. Sega had the Master System, a system that many said was a better machine and had more power, but it was destined to repeat the old 2600/5200 syndrome where it faded away from the States to find a strong home in Europe. What does all this lead to, you may ask? Repetition of history seems all too common and we just might be headed in that fateful direction.

We are now at a time when 16-Bit machines dominate the game scene, but the industry is buzzing about multimedia and other big words to draw attention to their products. Several companies either have released newer, more powerful hardware or are planning to do so. What does this mean for consumers? Way too many choices.

Don't get me wrong here. Choices are what make this country so great, but that doesn't mean there aren't problems, including video games. Ed Semrad mentioned in his editorial in the November 1993 issue that there were too many systems for the Christmas season, and that list is growing by leaps and bounds. Take a look at the Saturn, NEC 32-Bit, Project Reality, and the much hyped Sony PS-X. When are consumers going to call it quits and stick with their old stand-by systems and the large library of games they've accumulated, rather than shelling out big bucks for a new system that may not give them the quality and quantity of games players demand these days? I imagine that day will come soon, even though the hype from these big companies continues to entice the public that their systems offer the best features for the lowest price.

What has this hype gotten us? Well, although the 3DO got off to a really rocky start, the quality of software for this unit has improved tenfold and the price drop boosted sales as well. The 3DO could now have a stronger future than many predicted in the beginning. The Atari Jaguar is a powerful system, with upcoming games that really look good, but the problem comes in actually locating a Jaguar in a store. I've been to many retail shops in our area and all I see are a few games and spare controllers.

Not a great way to get consumers to believe that Atari is back from the grave. Then there's the LaserActive. This system needs a good kick in the rear to get the software out there and the price down to a somewhat reasonable level. Commodore has abandoned the Amiga CD for a stateside release. There are a few unnamed companies looking into picking it up, but right now, this sucker is dead in the water. It's too bad, since there is an abundant supply of software in Europe ready to come over. All this reinforces my original opinion. Every game company wants to get a system out on the market, but the public is becoming overwhelmed with systems that are barely getting by as it is. There needs to be more thought put into releasing new systems to make them original enough to survive in this flooded market.

61,No More Street Fighter II!,"
We received our finished copy of Super Street Fighter Il just the other day and of course everybody in the office gathered around waiting for their turn to play. After a couple of hours, the crowd cleared and the game just sat there. Noticing that, I asked everybody what they thought about the new version. The consensus was that it was OK, but it was just another version of SF2. Granted it is the best SF2 to date, but considering that it is the third time Capcom is redoing the game, they expected perfection.

The question I have is do we really need another revised and improved SF2? Judging by our staff's opinions in addition to the tons of letters we have already received from our readers, the answer seems to be no. Granted, if you are a street fighting fanatic, you will go out and buy the cart no matter what anybody says. But if you are an average player, you probably will be very disappointed after you play it for a while. At best I recommend that you rent it. Try the new characters and then decide if you want to spend the $70 to $80.

We don't think it's worth that kind of money. The problem is until the players stop buying the countless let's-make-a-couple-changes-and-call-it-super sequels, the companies will just keep on cranking out version after version. For example, do you really think that Capcom of Japan isn't working on a Super Turbo version? It's just not Capcom that does a lot of sequels. One can't forget EA's long list of Madden or NHL games. Or check any game list and look at the games with numbers in the titles. There are quite a few.

Gaming magazines are also guilty of perpetuating the sequel phenomenon. If you look at all of the reviews of Super SF2, you'll see a lot of smiling faces or near perfect numerical evaluations. I believe that these reviewers are missing the point of what a review is all about. Games aren't cheap and kids have to save up quite a while to get enough money for their next cart. I don't want to be the one who gives a 98 to a game which has a play time of less than one day before it is shelved because the player found out too late that the game is not much more than a cosmetic update of a game he already has. There has to be a better method of game evaluation.

So where do we stand? In our reviews we are going to start taking into account this type of excessive game program repetition in sequels. It's not an easy task as it is going to be subjective at first. Our goal is to take the aver-age' player into consideration. The one who already has an SF2 Turbo or a Madden '94. This player only buys a few games in a year and is not a person who has to have every sequel that comes out. Is this being excessively harsh on the sequel companies?' We don't think so. Take Super SF2 for example. I have to again fall back on the game reviewers in the weekly Japanese magazineFamicom Tsushin. How did they rate Super SF2? Objectively, as they do every game. For the first time we are seeing 7's in their Super SF2 multi-person review. More importantly, their arcade player Taco-X (who arguably is the best judge of arcade conversions), was one of those who gave it a 7!

What do you think, are we off-base with our low numbers, or has Street Fighter II finally run out of steam?

62,How Could You Do This?,"
No matter how many people look at the same issue of EGM, they will each have their own view of what's written. No matter how many letters we receive ndicting us for saying that Nintendo can do no wrong, we get just as many that say our motives should be questioned because we exclusively heap praise on Sega as the only company that can do things right.

Recently, I was witness to this type of individual interpretation when I casually drifted through the topics of a national bulletin board service. There was an enormous amount of banter concerning the last issue of EGM and a decision made by the Review Crew to gauge their opinions on Capcom's latest Street Fighter entry on the abundant similarities to previous installments of the game. While many agreed with the assessment of the reviewers that Street Fighter, unlike other fighter series, had failed to enhance the original enough to warrant an additional purchase, many felt the direction was totally inappropriate.

How could they do this? wrote one on-line scribe. Many echoed these sentiments and questioned how a Game Boy game could win the Game of the Month, award when the latest SF entry was clearly so much better.

The answer is simple. Given the following that the Street Fighter franchise has among players (look at the number of times EGM has featured the game on its cover), Capcom has occupied the enviable position of deciding on whether or not to create minor upgrades to the classic game or to expand on the concept in its totality. As is evidenced by the three separate versions of the game that are currently in circulation for the Super NES, Capcom has provided minor upgrades that, from the perspective of the reviewers that have been chosen to play them, have unfortunately become repetitive.

Sure, Super Street Fighter is a superior game to earlier efforts that got better scores, but if you go back a couple of years you'll see that Monaco GP got incredible ratings upon its release. Would that game garner the same 9's and 10's it received in 1992? Does the fact that the latest addition to the SF2 saga has new play elements automatically translate into an experience deserving of a higher score? Obviously, as the scores themselves illustrated last month, it does not. We employ separate reviewers to each independently look at carts to provide a variety of opinions and insure that no one person has the ability to flack a game. The benefits of this system are clearly evident.

So is it wrong that the Review Crew used their wealth of background knowledge and experiences to come to the conclusions that were made? As has been said in this space before, they rate each game on its own merits, but it would be just as unfair for them to ignore previous versions of the same game in their current critique as it would for them to be expected to give Monaco GP the ratings it received when it was released.

Why am I taking Ed's space in the editor's column this month? It's not solely to explain how expectations change over time, but to also highlight what Capcom did in response to the reviews this new game received. And it is that story I will relate to you next month

63,Making a Statement,"
I've received hundreds of letters about my column last month, and an equal number of theories on what I would be talking about in this issue. For those of you who may have missed the last installment of Insert Coin, I defended the position of our reviewing staff and their recent decision to give the latest Street Fighter game a less than perfect score.

While everyone has a different opinion of what elements band together to create good and bad playing experiences, I think it should be noted that EGM has ALWAYS, from its inception, put the reader first in this department. Even a casual perusal of other gaming magazines will illustrate the fact that the magazine you now hold has consistently, from its inception, provided the most critical appraisals of new game productsno matter which company produces them. In selecting those games that we review even the largest video game magazine does have space limitations) it has always been our goal to specifically focus on those games that have high profile licenses that will attract consumers (and often don't deliver the goods), as well as those games which display extraordinary qualities but, for lack of a license or recognizable name, fail to attract the attention of players. The four-person reviewing system that EGM established on these shores has always presented the most unbiased forum for true game analysis. That explains why the reviews in EGM are used by people throughout the video game industry as a barometer of quality and will never be compromised.

That's not to say companies don't try.

Over the six-year history of EGM, several large game publishers have attempted to pressure the magazine into compromising its integrity by withholding advertising support in response to a fair review which unfortunately does not heap praise on their products. This type of stance has cost EGM more than $500,000 in revenue, but no amount of money can buy back lost integrity. The guiding principle of this publication is that it is written for the reader, and it is this principle that has made EGM the biggest, most widely read, and most respected magazine in the video game industry.

Which gets us to the reason for this month's Insert Coin. When Capcom learned that they were receiving a less-than-perfect score for their latest repackaging of essentially the same game, they also tried to influence the readers of EGM by no longer supporting the magazine with ad information on upcoming game releases. According to Joe Morici, the head of marketing at Capcom, this action was taken to make a statement. Although I have thought long and hard, the only statement that I feel Capcom has made is that they don't have confidence in their products. Turning their back on the most savvy group of gaming enthusiasts, the readers of EGM, is the only response they could mustereven though I personally contacted Joe Morici for his opinion on the situation. Instead, he was unavailable and passed his policies off on another Capcom employee who apparently, from her lack of comment, embraced the same opinion.

Despite Capcom's position, however, EGM will continue to provide the first coverage of all of their products. Just because Capcom doesn't see any value in communicating with you, that doesn't mean that EGM, EGM, and all Sendai magazines aren't still written for the reader.

64,The Times They Are A Changin',"
As we approach the end of yet another year, Ed and I were sitting back looking at the wall in his office. As you can probably tell by the immense size of this issue, we weren't daydreaming. On Ed's wall is the front cover of every issue of every magazine that Sendai has ever published. Up until a couple of years ago, there was plenty of open space left, but now Ed, along with the rest of the EGM staff, have made their way into new digs on the other side of the building, partly as a result of the walls that are now covered with magazine covers.

As we traded jabs back and forth about which covers we felt looked the best (issue 63), which looked the worst (issue 8), and which sold the most (issue 54), we changed the subject of our conversation to what EGM would be covering in the months and years to come.

Just exactly which system will everyone be playing next year at this time? Which new platforms will be getting the most buzz? Which machines will carry us forward into the later half of the final decade of the final century in our second millennium?

The answer, some would say, is easy: the one that plays the best games. But as we witnessed during the most recent battles between competing game sys-tems, there are now other important factors that contribute to the success or failure of a game system. Little things like price, licensing and, yes, good quality game software. 3DO proved that a superior game machine with liberal licensing policies could attract plenty of industry attention, but its $700 initial price tag was just too steep for a machine that played games on the old family TV. Especially when there were other systems that did almost the same thing for only 88 bucks.

So will the next generation of game systems spell the end of gaming, or a fantastic new step? While Ed and I had our differences about what kind of price tag the new game machines must wear for widespread acceptance, we both agreed that the PlayStation, Ultra 64, Saturn, Super Genesis, and countless hand-helds will succeed in ushering in the next generation of game players into worlds that we could only have dreamed of six years ago when the pages of EGM were filled with articles on the 8-Bit systems. My how the times have changed!

65,Saturn Ahead of Its Time?,"
The new 32-Bit systems are on their way to the stores in Japan. As expected, both Sega and Sony waited until the very last minute to announce prices and available software. Sega, as predicted, was first to announce their system price (744,800 or about $465) and sure enough, just a few days later Sony announced the price of their PlayStation (·39,800 or about $410). Surprise, surprise, it was about $50 cheaper than the Saturn's. In addition, Sega could only muster up two games that will be available at launch (Virtua Fighter and Wan Chai Connection). Fortunately, the licensees were able to double that paltry number with a Mah Jong Tenjiku game from Chat Noir and Tama from Time-Warner Interactive. Sure sounds like the disastrous Mega CD launch all over again. Still, the Saturn presales are running at a record pace but these, we understand, are mostly from players who have to be the first one on the block to own one (including us!). Hopefully, Sega and their licensees will be able to get more software to the stores soon.

The first reports from the sales of Sony's PlayStation show very strong presales, also. One disadvantage that Sony has is that they are not a strong software manufacturer. Fortunately they have lined up a fantastic list of big-name third-party licensees, and where Sega has four titles available at launch, Sony has eight, including great titles like Ridge Racer, Parodius Deluxe and Raiden Project.

So who's on first? Kind of looks like a tie so far but Sony is hungry. Watch for a major price war after the gotta have it people have their systems.

Back in America, the people at Sega told me that they are going to watch the battle in Japan very carefully as it is highly probable that we will see the same thing happening here in 1995. They went on to say, though, that many of the games that are coming out in Japan will not make it out over here and they have a huge research and development staff already working on U.S. Saturn games in anticipation of a mid-1995 Saturn launch.

When contacted, Sony Computer Entertainment of America would not comment on any date, price, etc., of their PlayStation launch over here.

Closer to reality, the 32X is now out in the stores along with five carts. Not a spectacular launch but enough to keep the players happy through Christmas. If Sega and its licensees can continue to bring out the new carts and discs, this budget 32-Bitter has a good chance of surviving through the next couple of years until the Saturn's price comes from out of the sky and down to Earthlike around $200. And that ain't gonna' happen very soon  like 1997 by Sega's estimates. Until then it looks like the masses will just have to X it.

66,Nintendo Stumbled With Virtual Boy Intro!,"
At Nintendo of Japan's annual trade extravaganza, the Shoshinkai Show, Nintendo demonstrated their new 32-Bit, 3-D portable video game system called the Virtual Boy. It sounded intriguing. But after getting to play it for a while, I have a really hard time believing that U.S. players will welcome this new system with open arms.

The details are spelled out in our Shoshinkai special section elsewhere in this issue, but the screens aren't color, the games are mediocre, it will cost about $200 and it hardly is portable.

Not going to some kind of a color screen is the first major problem with the system. For $200 you get a two-color screenred and black. Why? Probably cost. This is 3-D and you need two screens. As we saw with the old TurboExpress from NEC, good quality, high-resolution LCD screens are VERY expensive. So Nintendo is going to keep costs down by giving us red LCDs on a black background. One would have thought that they learned their lesson from their no-color Game Boy. Strike one.

The games that were shown were nothing to get excited about. The fighting game-Teleroboxer, had the best 3-D imaging. Essentially it was Super Punch-Out with aliens. Their pinball game had a backward sloping playfield, kind of like their just-released Super Pinball for the Super NES. And, the best for last! It is no secret that Nintendo always launched their new game systems with a Mario game. For this system they didn't even have the courtesy to create something new. We get the ORIGINAL Mario game! Remember that one? Mario and Luigi jump up and punch the girders which flip the enemy over (remember the crabs?), and then they kick the bad guys off the screen for points. Yep, we now get it in almost 3-D. On Nintendo's behalf, the games were unfinished and less than half done so they could improve. Still, not a great selection of carts to show off the 3-D potential of the system. Strike two.

Portable? Did anybody say portable? Perhaps. It will give you seven hours of play time on six AA batteries, but where do you put it? You need your hands free to hold the controller and with the tripod mount you need a table to set it up on. Kind of tough to play it in the car on a trip. I heard rumors going around that there will be a chest-mounted tri-pod, but with the system completely covering your eyes, you just can't see anything but the game. I can picture the headlines in the tabloidsBoy walks in front of car while playing game! Nice design Nintendo. Strike three.

Last but not least, the price-$200. You would expect to get a lot more for that kind of money. Granted there has to be two of everything, as you literally need an independent system for each eye. But Nintendo knew this going in, and why they let it develop this far is anybody's guess. Things may change by the time the winter CES rolls around. But based on what was available at the Shoshinkai Show, this system needs work  a lot of work.

67,1995 The Year of the System War!,"
As we wrap up this issue and another year it's time to start planning our editorial calendar for 1995. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done. Sure there will be a lot of new systems all vying for your attention and dollars, but as the past has shown, not everybody can and will survive. So who do we focus on? Now that the magazines are getting smaller in size we certainly don't want to waste time and pages on never to be' systems like the FM Towns or Marty.

Some of the choices are very obvious. As you have seen from the past issues, we are giving extensive coverage to the Japanese Saturn and PlayStation. These are going to be the systems to watch in 1995. Nintendo is going to be the wild card. Their Ultra 64 is obviously coming but because of their tight-lipped attitude all we hear are rumors none of them positive. Hopefully they will wise up real quick and deliver some information to start getting people interested in their sys-tem. Then there is their Virtual Boy. Last month's editorial explained my feeling about that system. Perhaps they will have something at the Winter CES that will change my opinion.

The future of the existing systems are a little easier to pre-dict. The 3D0 is just now starting to get some really good games. If they get the system price down under $300 and preferably under $250, the system could continue to do well. Otherwise, like we have seen in Japan when the Saturn and PlayStation were launched, the 3D0 sales stalled. The Neo Geo CD, even at its sky-high price, will do well. It has a niche audience and SNK has reasonable expectations as to how well the system will do. The CD-i is on shaky ground. While it does play movies, it really needs a hot licensed title to get sales moving. The 32X has an image problem. Either people expect too much of it or the games aren't good enough to show off its true capa-bilities. The same goes for the Sega CD. While it is still selling, it does suffer from poor color, resolution and bad FMV games. Perhaps if it successfully couples with the 32X, both system's problems could be solved. The Jaguar is roaring but much of the time it has laryngitis. A constant stream of good software would be the best medicine for its sore throat.

It will be interesting a year from now to see who actually survived the system glut of 1995. One thing is for sure: The pie will be finely divided and it just won't be a Sega-Nintendo war anymore.

68,Sega vs. Sony The U.S. Battle Begins!,"
At the Winter Consumer Electronics Show very little was being publicly said about the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation. While both major companies had discussions with the press about their respective upcoming system, neither would go on record about the important details, such as when they will come out, how much they will cost and what the pack-in software will be. Things are different now. The companies are letting selected bits of information leak out,' perhaps to keep attention on their product, to scare the other guys or to honestly start reporting the facts, off the record, of course. Both companies have full-time staff to maintain contact with the media but the official word is still no comment.'

The most recent information (albeit rumors) are interesting nevertheless. Some sources are saying that the official release date for the Sega Saturn (the new official name) is July 11. Sega is sticking to late summer (August). Sony sources state that the PlayStation could hit as early as the end of June, but realisti-cally, with no distribution network in place, even late July would be highly optimistic. Anyway, there is little advantage to bringing the PlayStation out before the Sega Saturn. The advantage is to wait a week or so, then undercut the Sega price by $50.

Internal Sony sources are all hinting that their system will sell for $299, which would be great for the consumer (it certainly takes the air out of the projected $259 for the Ultra 64), but at that price there would be no profit in it for Sony. Perhaps their plan is to do the old razor-razor blade' sell tactic. It certainly will sell a lot of systems! Sega, for strategic reasons, will not officially state a price, but some sources are talking $399.

Numerous sources are telling us that Mortal Kombat Ill will be the pack-in for the PlayStation, an interesting statement considering the close relationship between Williams and Nintendo. It certainly would sell systems, though! Ridge Racer and Toshinden would be more realistic choices. We are hearing Virtua Fighter and Daytona will be the games packed in with the Sega Saturn. Not bad, but they have been working on converting Virtua Fighter 2 for some time and that would be a much better choice.

The one nice thing about rumors is that they change weekly. Stay tuned for the next batch. Meanwhile, check out the latest Japanese discs for these two great, new systems in our International section.

69,The Video Game Industry's Dirtiest Little Secret,"
For some time now, I have been personally concerned about what Sega, Nintendo and Sony will do to launch the Saturn, Ultra 64, and PlayStation respectively. Although both the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation exhibit strong potential to become the standard bearer of the later '90s, and the SGI graphics demos that Nintendo runs at the shows sure look nice, there is a dirty little secret in this industry that exists as equal parts marketing strategy and competitive gamesmanship.

I'm talking about the retail price of these new mega machines.

There's a lesson to be learned from the experiences that 3DO has endured in its short history. After riding high the wave of speculation that a common standard could be created and licensed out to various manufacturers for mass consumption, the final product has had its problems at retail. 3DO had their ducks in a perfect row, with multiple licensees, little risk to publishers in manufacturing costs or inventory, and a truly state-of-the-art piece of equipment on which to program. Despite all of these facts, the system still had difficulty gaining widespread acceptance due in large part to one thing: its cost.

Although the 3DO was a better machine with the most cohesive vision of what entertainment in the future should be like, the company could not convince casual gamers and parents that their system was $600 better than your average Sega or Nintendo 16-Bit. Furthermore, the fact that the manufacturers of the 3DO hardware like Goldstar and Panasonic had no immediate interest in software revenuesan area that Sega, Sony, and Nintendo all enjoyit became difficult for the price of the 3DO to come down as rapidly as required because the manufacturers of the hardware had no other revenue sources from which to offset the proposed losses that went hand-in-hand with reducing the unit's price.

This fall we'll see the first effects of 3DO's initial launch. All three of these game systems were created to cash in on what was perceived to be a slam dunk entry into the market by 3DO. When at least one of these units was in the design stages, it was considered OK to come in over $400. Heck, I'm sure the developers reasoned, we'll still be $300 less than that successful 3DO machine.

There are encouraging signs. Rumors are rampant that both Nintendo and Sony are willing to take mammoth losses on the hardware-as much as $100-to get them into players' hands at a reasonable price. Expect to see a daily war of tit-for-tat between all three system providers at the upcoming E3 show in Los Angeles where all three machines are to debut. Hopefully the free market will prevail and we'll see low-priced PlayStations and Saturns alongside $250 Ultra 64s.

The can simply be no alternative. Even 3DO has learned that lesson, gaining the attention it originally deserved two years ago.

70,Silence Is Not Always Golden,"
Last month Steve talked about the dirty little secret in our game industry. Besides price, there are other factors that determine whether a new game system will be a hit or a miss. One of those is the way the product is introduced to the public Setting aside the millions of dollars that the companies spend on media ads, a lot of product-hype in the form of hands on reviews by the experts' at the various game mags goes a long way in free promotion and helps focus the player's interest toward or away from certain systems. Early hype, for example, has been good for Sony's PlayStation, but sometimes things backfire and the press is unmercifully negative. Sega's 32X and Nintendo's Virtua Boy are examples of systems that got trashed by the press. It's a fine line that marketing departments have to walk as to when it is too early to show a product.

Problems arise, though, when the companies keep things too quiet for too long. This leads to nasty rumors about the various new products. Nintendo's deafening silence about their Ultra 64 has done nothing to help the company's image. Turn to any game forum on the Net and all the positive talk is for Sony or Sega's new machines.

In talking with game developers at the ECTS in London last week, the rumors are pretty much the same there as they are here. It's PlayStation this or Saturn that. Nintendo was rarely mentioned and never in a positive manner. Some of it could be spoiled grapes because only a handful of the best are getting the opportunity to do Ultra 64 development but rumors were being spread freely and openly. The press was taking it all in and over the next few months, there should be a whole new batch of half-truth gossip about all of the items that the companies have been holding back.

Why all the secrecy in the first place? It's a dog-eat-dog world in the game industry and if the press talks too soon about Sega's 64-bit cartridge machine then Sony has enough time to direct some of their R&D dollars into making a similar product. Similarly, if the fact leaks out that Sega is doing a 32X Virtua Fighter cart, then fewer players will go out and purchase the more expensive Saturn because they want to play that game.

Perhaps there is a happy medium, but with the magazine business as competitive as it is, the days of the old VG & CE attitude of I won't print it until it is in the stores are long gone. The attitude now is that the first news sells magazines and whoever gets the information first wins.

Who's right? Depends on who you talk to. The companies continue to stick to their I'll tell you when I'm ready attitude and the magazines run to other second-hand sources for their information. Each complains about the other being unresponsive to the their needs. Nothing new, just business as usual.

71,The End of an Era?,"
It is no deep, dark secret that there aren't a lot of new games out for the 16-Bit game systems. Our Super NES and Genesis Fact-File sections have been steadily decreasing in size each month, and we don't see any large influx of new games coming in the near future. It would appear that many of the game companies (both large and small) who got burned with excess inventory last Christmas are bailing out of the order-right-or-die cartridge market and moving to the less risky, CD-on-demand, 32-Bit platforms.

Unfortunately, a lot of these companies are now going to miss out on a huge, already established market this Christmas. Some companies come back and say that they can't afford to stay because it has become a rich man's sport as it takes a lot of money to make money. It isn't just the Acclaims, Time Warners and Segas who are staying in the 16-Bit market. There are a few niche market companies like Koei, Enix and Square Soft who are doing quite well, thank you. Why? What's their secret? Knowledge of their market and good games. It's that simple: These companies don't have grandiose plans of selling millions of carts so they order just the right number of games. Their software is top notch and not just another me-too fighting game because that happens to be the current fad. They constantly improve on their sequels and don't just add the word Super or Turbo and push the game out the door.

In essence, the days of anything will sell are over. To succeed, a company needs an innovative game design, exceptional programming, creative marketing and lots of hype and advertising. The big guys are doing just that and they are making money in the 16-Bit market. The little guys too, only everything is scaled back. I was told by one of the major players that they were greeted with open arms by all the key retailers and this company plans to make 75 percent of the company's income on one 16-Bit game!

Where does this put everybody else who gave up on the Super NES and Genesis? Up to the 32-Bit CD market. They are calling it progress and game evolution. These companies have actually taken the easy way out. Unfortunately if they don't figure out why they failed in the cartridge market, these companies will just do the same thing all over again in the CD market. By thinking they are out first on the new systems they will make a killing. It's going to happen, just watch. By the end of the year there will be dozens of Doom clones and scores of hastily produced polygon fighting games for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn collecting dust on the store shelves. And the suits at these companies will scratch their heads and ask, Why? Nothing will change. Companies will disappear and new ones will pop up, hopefully with new and better ideas. It's business as usual only the bits are higher.

72,"It's What You Do, Not When You Do It","
By now it is no deep dark secret that Nintendo has decided to postpone the U.S. launch date of their Ultra 64 until April of next year. In a very carefully worded speech, Howard Lincoln stated that the extra time would be used to give their green ($) team  excuse me, dream team of licensees time to put the finishing touches on their soft-ware. As for the hardware he stated that it is ..essentially complete.

Essentially complete? When asked for a definition of essentially, Nintendo execs stated that the chip set is done but the circuitry just has to be shrunk down to fit in the case.

Then why not show the games with cords going into a wall? Or show a tape of the software? No one would directly answer that question. Sources have stated that their U64 version of Killer Instinct is over 80 percent done, as are a couple of other carts. Nintendo has shown beta versions of games before, so why not now?

It has been my opinion for several months now that it has to do with Nintendo of Japan (NOJ). New hardware introductions (NES, Game Boy, Super NES, Virtual Boy) have always appeared in Japan first  normally at their Shoshinkai Trade Show. Several months ago when NOJ moved the Shoshinkai dates back from August to November something was up. It could only be because the Ultra 64 was to debut there. And, as we know now, it will.

With the debut pushed back to November, in Japan there is just no way it would launch here the very next month. That's why we have been stating for months that it would not be coming out in the U.S. this year. Others naively continued to say that it would make it out this fall and one even picked a Sept. 29 date. Oh well.

As to the real launch of the Ultra 64, as expected, it will be in JAPAN FIRST. While Mr. Lincoln was very specific in his speech not to say anything about the launch of the system in Japan  only North America and Europe (April 1996), his people later admitted that the Japan launch will be before April, and possibly as early as December.

Why the delay? Perhaps the real question should be what's the hurry? Ii you were the company that controls over 90 percent of the Japanese game market and a majority of the U.S. market, would you rush out too early with something new? So what if Sony and Sega sell a half a million new sys-tems. That is nothing in a long-range plan. Besides, at $299 and $399, the competitor's new systems will move slowly after the early adapters buy out the first shipments. If Nintendo comes in with a $199 price (their internal price goal  watch them announce it at the January CES) they will catch up in just one season. Even faster in Japan  if not instantaneous domination, if they get Square to do FF 7 for the Ultra.

Don't count Nintendo out yet! The year 1996 will be very interesting!

73,Test Marketing Is It Worth It?,"
By now it is no deep dark secret that Sega jumped the gun and brought out their new Saturn game system some three months before their official launch date. When asked why, Sega officials gave various reasons including beating Sony to the stores, the system was ready, and they wanted to test the waters to see how well a $400 system would be received by the gaming public.

Concentrating on the last reason, one would wonder what type of response Sega really expected to get. They are apparently pleased that the 30,000 units sold out, but that shouldn't have been a big surprise because there are 10 times that amount of players that would do anything to get a U.S. Saturnat any price. These early adapters are the ones who have to be the first one on the block to own the new system. I'm one of them.

It would seem to be quite difficult to do any type of research that would help Sega form conclusions as to how the system would do when there are other new machines in the stores selling for less money. The sample would be EXTREMELY BIASED toward Sega. Still the statisticians are cranking out numbers and the suits will probably make marketing decisions based on the test. Bad? Probably not.

Then why test market (albeit nationwide)? Well, it worked quite well for Nintendo back in 1985 when they brought back the concept of home video games. Plus, there is the positive pre-exposure that would help sell the system when it launches in September.

So if it so great, why don't all the hardware manufacturers do it? Atari did it with their Jaguar. And Sony almost did it with their PlayStation. Almost? A couple of months ago we saw the PlayStation up on the computers at a major retail chain. That is how we knew that the Saturn would come out before their announced September launch date. The problem is, after a week on the store computers, the record for the system disappeared as fast as it appeared. Second thoughts? Perhaps. Also Sony could be looked on as copying Sega. And what about Nintendo? They just might test market the system this Christmas. Since the system will launch with a couple of titles in Japan in December, Nintendo could surprise everybody and still make some bucks in the peak Christmas season. Also, since Nintendo mysteriously pulled out of the Winter CESthe time when they would want to finally display the real system to the retailers, one would wonder what Nintendo is up to. Only time will tell.

In other news; don't miss the very first coverage of a PC game in EGM. PC? Yep, our MRI tells us that more than half of our readers own and use a PC and coupled with tons of letters asking for computer game coverageyou got it. Not pages and pages of the hardcore sims, but only the best of the fun games. Controversial, you bet! Let us know what you think.

74,We Know Who You Are,"
Don't take that headline too personally. Well, maybe you should because this editorial concerns you. From our large subscription database: 1,000 of you were selected to be involved in a survey. Those who responded in the categories of Male Teens Ages 12-17 and Adults 18+ have helped us learn more about you. Items like what you eat and drink, what game systems you own and fun stuff like other game magazines you might happen to read have been revealed. Many of you may be interested in the results of this survey and the following is a small sample of the responses we received.

To begin, in the 12-17 category, we learned that 26.8 percent of you have subscribed to EGM for 2-3 years; 25.3 percent for 1-2 years and 16.2 percent for less than a year. Those of you who are 18 and older had slightly different numbers. Some 23.4 percent of you subscribed for 2-3 years; 23.3 percent for 1-2 years and 18.3 percent For less than a year. More interesting responses (to you anyway) have helped us change EGM to suit your needs.

Because a whopping 52.9 percent (ages 12-17) and 49.3 percent (18+) own personal computers, it seemed only natural that we should provide exciting PC coverage. This issue is no different. Because 87 percent (12-17) and 85 percent (18+) of you use computers for gaming, the coverage of PC titles in EGM will grow.

Now for the information that many of you probably always wanted to know: What is our subscribers' most popular system? We were always curious ourself and the results aren't really that shocking. 71.6 percent own a Super NES in the ages 12-17 category. Also in that category, 62.5 percent own a NES; 65.3 percent own a Genesis; 49 percent own a Game Boy; 24.9 percent own a Sega CD; 16.8 percent own a 32X; 30.1 percent own a Game Gear; 6.6 percent own a 3DO; 8.6 percent own a TG-16; 4.3 percent own a Jaguar and 2.8 percent own a NeoGeo. Those of you who are 18 and older will pleased to know that 71.6 percent also own a Super NES; 54.3 percent own a NES; 67.1 percent own a Genesis; 39.1 percent own a Game Boy; 28.2 percent own a Sega CD; 16.3 percent own a 32X; 26.3 percent own a Game Gear; 10.3 percent own a 3DO; 10 percent own a TG-16; 7.3 percent own a Jaguar and 3.1 percent own a NeoGeo. Now you can see how you compare to your buddies!

That's not all. The survey also indicated what types of games you buy, how many games you buy, the area where most of our subscribers live and much more. This information may seem trivial, but it's crucial in determining what our subscribers like and dislike about us and the rest of the world. If we survey our readers again and you are selected, please take the time to fill it out.

75,Going Out With a Bang,"
We're coming upon a whole new era. It seems that every year something new happens in the industry to completely shake everything up. This particular situation is the release of the Sony PlayStation. This system has promised and delivered home video games that the general public couldn't even dream of more than a year ago. This release, coupled with the Sega Saturn and the much-anticipated Ultra 64, will undoubtedly set the standard for gaming, but for how long? The video gaming world is changing faster than most people realized or even anticipated and this will only lead to questions that few can answer.

All this leads to the headline. The Super NES and Genesis, the two perennial favorites of the world, are going out with a bang. As the Sega Saturn and PlayStation gain a stranglehold on your minds and wallets, those 16-bit workhorses are having some of the best games ever designed for 16-Bit being released for them. Just take a look at Crono Trigger, Yoshi's Island, Mortal Kombat 3 and the upcoming Super Mario RPG for the Super NES. Then there is Comix Zone, Vectorman, College Football USA '96 and the upcoming Earthworm Jim 2 for the Genesis. All these games represent the best games that these systems have seen in a long time. But unfortunately, not many of you will be willing to play them once the PlayStation and Saturn become the main staple of your TV diets.

But that's not a bad thing. Change is good and I'm all for these big-buck games with lots of flash and pizazz, but if they don't offer the plain old fun that video games should offer, then what's the point? Games like Centipede or Asteroids had no plot. No princess to save or evil villain to slay. In fact, those games should be inferior to everything nowadays, but I found myself playing Asteroids and Centipede on GameBoy long after the review was fin-ished. Why? Fun! How many games these days just let you sit there, shoot things, collect points and try to survive. You could probably count those games on one hand. I'm not saying that none of these upcoming PlayStation, Saturn or Ultra 64 games won't be fun, but I most certainly hope they don't rely on gimmicky graphics to sell themselves. That will only lead to disappointment.

In closing I'd like to say that I am all for change' and as of this writing, have pre-ordered a PlayStation. Many of you knew about some stores sales pitch of trading in older 16-bit games to get a discounted price on the PlayStation. I also took advantage of this incredible deal and traded in a whole slew of old games, but there were some I did not. Why? Because games like Herzog Zwei, M.U.S.H.A. and Thunder Force 3, all for the Genesis mind you, offered too much fun to give up. And if the PlayStation doesn't offer the fun I want in modern games, at least I'll have some old favorites to turn to when I need them.

76,A Sony PlayStation Free?,"
The analysts are at it again. With nine months of less-than-expected video-game hardware and software sales, the experts are already predicting another dismal year for our industry. Worse yet, with the exceptionally high price of the next-generation systems coupled with the phenomenal growth of the PC CD-ROM industry, many are saying that the game boom has now been changed to doom.

Could it really happen? Is it just the U.S. or is it worldwide? Our editors have recently returned from a 20,000-mile Chicago-London-Tokyo-Chicago world trip and while they confirm that both Europe and Japan are feeling the pinch this year, everybody is optimistic about 1996.

For example, the games market in Europe is down 35 percent from 1993 but with the new systems starting to sell through, the forecasts for 1996 are expecting a bounce-back of over 20 percent. Retailers aren't taking the lower game sales without a fight though. Like the trade in the old system' deal that U.S. retailers are using to drive sales of the new hardware, the U.K. game retailers have gone and offered Acclaim's Batman Forever cart for under 19 (about $27) when you trade in three old 16-Bit games.

Japan has always been a harder market to read. The new systems are selling well but the newness hasn't worn off yet. Players there have always had an interest in new systems as shown by strong early sales of the FM Towns Marty, Laser Active and PC-FX. This trend may be starting to slow down, though, as we noticed one retailer selling the Virtual Boy for $95 (¥9709) stating that It's not selling. On the software side, games come and go very rapidly, and while there isn't a rental market in Japan, used game stores are common and preowned cart sales are strong. Overall, the market is down from 1993 but expected to rise in 1996.

And the U.S.? The new systems appear to be selling, but now Sony and Sega have gotten into a press release numbers war. Both claim 120,000 systems in players' homes. The big push will be Christmas, of course, and not only will there be dozens of new 32-Bit games to choose from, but the big guys who decided to stick it out in the 16-Bit market are expected to be SMILING all the way to the bank.

Bottom line, we've all taken our lumps this year as no hardware transition is ever easy to weather, but with over a quarter million 32-Bit systems already in the homes, hopefully we'll hit the magical million units yet this year.

In other news, we hope you will like the new look of EGM. This time around we have decided to beef up some of our sections with more text. The whole look is easier to read and more informative. Let us know what you think.

77,Nintendo Loosens Up Security,"
In a surprise move Nintendo of Japan has opened up their doors to their ultra top-secret 64-Bit video game system. Not a lot mind you, but just a crack. However, our Japanese correspondent is quick and he was able to sneak in and out before the door slammed shutnot to be opened again until Nov. 24, which is the big day when the Nintendo 64 is unveiled.

Nintendo 64? Yes, at least that's what Nintendo will call its new system in Japan. One rumor has it (and there are plenty of them floating around) that Nintendo couldn't call it the Ultra 64 because the trademark was already taken for the Asian market, or, it could be that Nintendo just wanted to call their system something differentlike the Super Famicom vs. Super NES names for their 16-Bit systems. Take your pick, or make up your own rumor and start circulating it on the Net

What our correspondent found in Japan was a real picture of a production Nintendo 64 controller. Yeah, there has been one floating around for some time now but that was just a sketch by one of the Japanese magazines. Don't miss our special coverage on this and the new Nintendo 64 modem network in our Press Start section. The other news was the fact that Nintendo really must have things moving along because the new photo of the Japanese system is exactly the same as the one of the U.S. Ultra 64 released way back in May at E3. There is no news, however, as to when the system will actually come out either in Japan or here. Why? More Nintendo secrecy.

It seems that they are really clamping down on the Dream Team to not release any screen shots of the games being worked on. You can see this in the interview with Steve Race where he wouldn't even call it the Ultra 64 and also because they show nothing but the Title screen of Spectrum HoloByte's Ultra 64 Top Gun game. Of course one month from now we'll all know what is really happening. Don't miss our exclusive Ultra 64 coverage in our January issue.

78,Being Last is Not Always Best,"
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for: Nintendo's Ultra 64. This system has been shrouded in secrecy ever since the beginning, and now EGM and all you readers are going to have a look at the future of gaming. (That was hype I just fed you. Did you fall for it? Probably, and why shouldn't you?) Everyone in the gaming community, including this magazine, has been touting the U64 as the most incredible system on the planet, and maybe it is. However, before you get lured into saving every penny you've got just to buy a U64 (or N64 in Japan), take the time to look at the full picture and listen to what I have to say.

The aura surrounding the PlayStation, Saturn and Jaguar releases has hardly had time to fade away, and yet here comes Nintendo, ready to strut its stuff. Are all of you PlayStation, Saturn and Jaguar owners truly sick of your new systems and must now buy a U64 to quench your thirst for all things new? I'll bet Nintendo is counting on that. What the are not counting on are the parents who are probably fed up with little Johnny and Jane's expensive habit of getting new game systems. Heck, this hobby ain't cheap. There comes a time when every consumer must say, I've had enough. While 1 can't speak for everybody (even though I try), I think many of you will agree with me.

Could there be another repeat of those special offers? You know, Hey, trade in your crusty, old PlayStation, Saturn or Jaguar and 10 games from these primitive systems and bring home a brand-spanking new Ultra 64 for X-amount of dollars. Hurry, we could use the quick cash! Sorry, but I've grown quite fond of my PlayStation, despite my earlier reluctance to purchase one. Software companies are showing full support and the games, for the most part, are quite excellent.

Besides, it's not my fault I bought a PlayStation because Nintendo kept delaying the U64. I have no doubt Nintendo will stand behind its new baby for a long time to come. I'm sure it will be a good system, but I just don't expect everyone to rush out and buy it for its near $300 price (unless you didn't buy a new system this year). I'm afraid I'll find myself at home playing my PlayStation on the Ultra 64 launch date. Sorry.

79,Ultra 64 Unveiled,"
The suspense is over. All of the editors have been there and done that. As expected, Nintendo did have a lot of systems up and running at the Shoshinkai Show. (I didn't count to see if there were the promised 100 machines). Unfortunately, in the typical Nintendo tradition of secrecy, they decided to show as little of their software as possible. I mean, you can't get much less than two playable games, especially when one was reportedly just 50 percent done (Super Mario 64), and the other only 20 percent complete (Kirby Ball 64). Nintendo did show a videotape with very early footage of another 11 games but with less than three minutes of actual gameplay on the promo tape, if you blinked you could have missed a title. Even the systems were untouchable as they were all encased in plastic. Their spec sheet was bare bones and non-revealing, and the execs were talkative but well rehearsed as to what not to say.

Was the show a bust? Probably to those who expected Nintendo to show everything. But, this is Nintendo. They don't play by anybody's rules except their own.

Expecting the worst, or in this casethe leastI came away from the show satisfied. I found out the system was actually real; I got to test out the controller (they had to let us touch that); and I got to play the two games. Sure I would have liked to have played more carts, gotten more information and seen the games that they decided not to show, but that just makes our job that more important in the upcoming months.

And the result? Some editors have been quite vocal about how the system wasn't what they expected. Others were their usual noncommittal. As for meokay Nintendo mark this down as a firsthere comes a complimentI was very very impressed. Super Mario is a virtual world. It is something that I was able to get completely immersed in because of the superb 3-D animation of characters like Koopa, Bullet Bill and the Piranha Plant, that were only seen before in flat 2-D perspective. Kirby was similarly spectacular, with the hill and valley effects so well done on this system I could actually feel the roller-coaster effect as my character moved through the game. And this was on a game that was only 20 percent complete! I can't wait to see what a finished version will be like.

On the downside, these are games that Nintendo themselves created. They have to be good. Looking at the tape, some of the non-Nintendo games were far from spectacular. Also, Nintendo's games have generally been for a younger audience. Hopefully they will add some serious titles like RPGs and strategy sims. Finally, other than the spectacular 3-D effects, the games weren't as revolutionary as they were when the 16-Bit Super NES came out. I mean what do we have, more Mario, Star Fox, Kirby, Pilot Wings, Mario Kart and ZeldaI'm willing to give them more time, though.

80,Expensive Gaming,"
By now everybody is probably really getting into the new 32-Bit game systems. Did you get one for Christmas along with a couple of game discs? I bet you also took the grandparents' typical money gift and on Dec. 26, ran to the local game store for even a few more hot titles. Sound familiar? By now you are probably tired of them and have had to buy a few games with your own money. What did you think of the game prices? Sucks, doesn't it? Sixty to seventy bucks for a few hours of decent gameplay is almost robbery. The shirts at Sony, Sega, Namco or whomever the game company is must be sitting back and having a good chuckle about how they can spend all the money they are making from the sales of their games.

Well, yes and no. If you're Sony or Sega, the execs are breathing a small sigh of relief and saying, Finally some money. It's the old razor and razor blade thing again. They are just now starting to get something back from the bath they took when they lowered the price of the systems to $299.

But does that help us? Not when we have to pay $70 for one game. Unfortunately, that is the pay me now or pay me later philosophy either pay more for the system up front or pay more for the games later.

Think about it though, if we let the hardware companies make a fair profit on the console up front by paying $100 more for the system, it would be a lot cheaper in the long run than paying $10 (or more) extra each time we buy a game. Hey, devoted gamers buy more than 10 discs in one year! Hmmm perhaps the hardware execs planned this all along.

Are the game prices ever going to go down? I'm not holding my breath. Companies will say that production costs have gone through the roof. SGIs are the norm these days for development and no company can have just one. Motion capture is a necessity and that doesn't come cheap. Go without it and try to cut corners and editors like us will trash the game because it doesn't animate properly. Throw in some FMV and it is time for actors and a whole motion-picture crew. Yeah, we've heard the whole story before.

We can complain all we want but the bottom line is that we were the ones who brought all of this on. Things were so simple back in the good old days when everything was sprite-based. These are the '90s and realism is the thing. It's like the good life, once we get a taste of it (I'm still waiting for that), there is no turning back. It's a tough nut to swallow but every time I buy a new game, I think about how much things have changed since I bought my first game back in the '70s.

81,N64 Delayed Again?,"
So what's new? We (and 99 percent of the journalists in the world) khew that this would happen months ago. There was just no way that Nintendo could make enough systems for both Japan and the U.S. by the end of April.

What was a big surprise was the wire service announcement that we got right at deadline stating that the Nintendo 64 could be delayed until late July in Japan! A last-minute call to Nintendo U.S. verified that this is indeed what Nintendo of Japan stated to its local business newspapers. The reason for the delay this timethere apparently is a temporary shortage of the key semiconductors that go into the N64. Also, should the supply of these unique parts continue, then the N64 will have to be delayed until an even later point in time. When questioned further, the Nintendo representative stated this parts shortage, if it continues even longer than currently expected, may affect the launch for the rest of the world (including the U.S.). The Nintendo rep. also supplied us with a clip from ReutersM, one of the most respected wire services. The company paint a brighter picture by quoting a Nintendo of Japan spokesperson who stated, We cannot rule out delaying it [N64], yet at this moment we have no plan to do so. Doesn't sound good. The issue is not clear though. Another article on Feb. 15th, just two days later, states that there is no shortageso go figure.

Now everybody has something new to wonder and complain about. Is there a real parts shortage, or was this a plan of Nintendo's all along? Did they deliberately say April so that some players would put off a Christmas 1995 purchase of a Saturn or PlayStation? No one will ever know; but this is Nintendo. As Mr. Yamauchi, the president of Nintendo of Japan, stated at the last Shoshinkai Show, We will do what we want when we want to. We will not bend to any outside pressure. We'll update this further next month.

In a second unrelated issue, you will see a preview of a new Sega of Japan (Japan-only) arcade game on page 102. The tentative title is Virtua Fighter Kids. To my P.R. friends at Capcom. rip this page out of all the issues that are going to the suits in your company! As everybody can see from this month's cover, Capcom has not yet decided to expand its counting ability to three. Yep, they have decided to continue the sequalitis this time to their new Street Fighter Alpha line of games. But, the point isCapcom, what are you going to do after this game? Let me make a suggestion:

Do not do what Sega did with their VF series. Please don't succumb to the pressure of doing a Street Fighter 2 Kids coin-op. Perhaps, (can I say it?) the real SF3? All kidding aside, good job on SF Alpha 2. With the typical superb fine-tuning that you do on your games, this fighter will be the best (and last?) of the series.

83,3-D Action Games,"
This fall there will be a major change in the way we will be playing games. For the first time, we will actually be able to play a game in the third dimension. Granted we have already seen games like Bug! and Jumping Flash which partially made use of the in-and-out of the screen dimension and are best called 2 1/2-D games, but now with new programming skills and techniques, games are being created from the ground up to make full use of the third dimension.

The EGM editors recently visited Accolade and Crystal Dynamics to try out early copies of Bubsy 3D and Pandemonium. Needless to say, we were very impressed. Bubsy, for example, literally has miles of pathways that take you up and down the winding terrain. Pandemonium, with its beautifully rendered, highly detailed graphics and safe 3-D trails, lets you run through mazes at Sonic-like breakneck speeds. Also this month, we have been able to preview a few of the other new 3-D action games including Sega's Nights and Sonic 3-D and Sony's new mascot game Crash Bandicoot. Lastly, one can't leave out Nintendo's Mario 64 which, when released in Japan later this month, will be the first 3-D game on the market and an indication of what we can expect later this year on all of the other systems. Of course, you don't have to wait that long because we have previews of all of these games elsewhere in this issue.

Another special feature we have in this issue is our exclusive E3 Preview Guide. In the past we have always waited until after the trade show to get you pictures, but all the mags have copied our idea and are doing that now. Besides, who wants to wait that extra month anyway? So we sent our editors up and down the West Coast, gathering everything the companies will be showing at E3. When we found out that there was more (some were holding a few games back as surprises), we went to Japan and England to track down the secret games. All in all, we have devoted more than 25 pages of this issue to detailing all the new games that will be coming out later this year. That's not all! Next issue we will wrap up the show coverage with previews of the remaining few games which even we couldn't track down this month.

Finally, now that the Japanese Saturn is selling for $200, we ought to see Sega again do a surprise announcement at E stating that the U.S. will match that price this fall. It should be a great way to give the Saturn the extra boost during the Christmas season. However, Sony knows that too, so we fully expect another one-word speech from their suits at E' stating, $199! And Nintendo..$250 doesn't sound as great now as it did three years ago. We believe that they will also roll out at $199 in September. Sounds like a great holiday shopping seasongreat gamesgreat prices!

Thanks Dano for all the years of dedication and devotion you put toward the mag. We'll all miss you.

For the second year in a row, the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) proved to be the most important event in the world for the video game industry.

We've heard reports that there were anywhere from 1,000 to 1,700 games and products on display at the recently held E3 video game trade show. No matter what the number, it was a lot. So many that if you combine all of the new games shown at all of the other gaming trade shows in the world held in the past year, you wouldn't reach the amount of games shown here. I've been to them all, and nothing even came close to E3.

But it is a game show, and everybody who attended didn't walk away disappointed. Nintendo wowed the world with playable N64 versions 1 of Mario, Pilotwings, Killer Instinct and more. And judging from the constantly long lines of people waiting to play Mario, the suits at Nintendo have to be very pleased with what they saw. Mario 64 was in our opinion the game of the show. The downside to this spectacular product was the announcement that there will not be enough N64 systems to go around this year. We've heard numbers of only about 500,000 systems coming to the U.S., so if you want one, don't wait too long to get your order in.

On the Sega front, the $199 price (effective immediately) will really be a shot in the arm for the Saturn. Couple that with perhaps its best lineup of games in years, led by NiGHTS, Bug Too! and nearly perfect conversions of current arcade hits like Virtua Cop 2, Manx TT and Fighting Vipers, and it's easy to see that Sega is back.

Sony, on the other hand, isn't going to let the competition try to catch up. Sony officials started the $199 price war, and with great games like lekken 2, Crash Bandicoot, Twisted Metal 2 and more than 100 other hot new titles, they hope to put even more distance between number one and number two. Needless to say, we the gamers will finally be able to reap the benefits of this price, system and game war. I can't wait until Christmas.

Games aside, there is one other point that should be brought up. Astute readers will already have noticed the change in our masthead. Sendai Publishing has just been acquired by Ziff-Davis Publishing [a division of Soft Bank]. That was our big news at E3.

How does this affect the magazine? Fortunately it is a win/win situation. All of the staff are still here and the mag still looks the same, but with the additional massive resources of Ziff, you can expect to see some really big improvements in the coming months. I can't talk about them quite yet, but stay tuned!

As you can see from the masthead, there are more changes taking place here at the magazine. Most notably, we have a new publisher. Steve Harris is moving on to head up our online service NUKE in addition to pursuing projects that he always wanted to do, but never really had the time.

In retrospect, I've known and worked with Steve for a long time. In fact, we go back to well before issue one of EGM when I was writing a game column for the Milwaukee Journal and Steve was an award-winning world class game player who had an idea of starting the first game magazine. There are a lot of fond memories of the good old daysthe times before computers. Those were the days when page layouts were done by cutting and pasting (with scissors and tape and not the computer) and game maps were created by taping small screen shot photographs together. In addition, back then there were no video cameras or digital image capture boards. We did all the work the old-fashion waywith a 35 mm camera. It was always easy to spot the EGM people at trade shows because of the high-tech cone we carried along with us to help us take photographs of the game screens so we could be the first to get the information to the readers. But I digress.

I've always been amazed how Steve could single-handedly run the company and yet still find the time to constantly tweak all of the sections in our magazines so we would always be one step ahead of all of the other guys. And when it came to covers, no item was too small or unimportant. He would spend hours agonizing over every detail, making sure everything was perfect. If there was something hot that came in at the last minute, there was always time to get it in the issue. All that meant was that we had to make up the time by driving faster to get the pages to the film house.

But being the best didn't come easy. There would be many a night when I would be leaving to go home at 10 p.m. and Steve would still be in his office working on a new idea. And this would go on seven days a week.

However, over the past seven years Steve was quietly, and patiently, preparing all of us for that inevitable day when the training wheels would be taken off the bike and we would ride on our own.

We're at that point now, but we're not alone. Steve made sure that we are in good hands. With Jonathan Lane, our new publisher, and the backing of the tremendous resources of Ziff-Davis and Soft Bank of Japan, we now have the ability to take our publications to heights never before dreamed of in any game magazine. If things go well, the changes to the magazine should begin in the October issue. We are starting to prepare for it now, but what will happen will have to remain a surprise for a while yet.

All of us here wish Steve the best of luck in the future. You've trained us well and we will continue to work hard to keep EGM the number one video game magazine in the industry.

Thanks Steve.

The Nintendo 64 launch in Japan was apparently a success with all 500,000 game systems reportedly sold in a matter of days. But was it really the beginning of a new generation in video games?

First, let's look at the numbers. While selling a half million systems is certainly a great way to roll out a product, one has to remember that it happened in Japan. Even Pioneer's LaserActive and NEC's PC-FX sold very well when they were introduced, mainly because Japanese game players like new technology and aren't hesitant to spend a few hundred dollars for something new. We'll have to wait and see how well the second production run of N64s sells later this month. If all 300,000 sell out, Nintendo could just break the magical 1 million mark in a matter of a couple of months.

On the game front, Super Mario 64 was also a hot item. The story is that it was selling on a 1-to-1 basis with the systems. Nothing new here, players have to play something on the new system. Anyway, who could resist playing the best 3-D game ever made? It was no surprise when it easily got the number one spot on the Famitsu's weekly game chart. At press time, Super Mario 64 still remained at number one for the second week. PilotWings 64 is a different story. It started at the number-four spot and quickly dropped to number seven the second week.

Apparently the Japanese game players' interests quickly switched to the new second- and third-gen-eration Saturn and PlayStation games like International Track & Field and KOF '95. Perhaps PilotWings will have a more loyal following here in the U.S. The third N64 launch title? Don't even ask. The uninspiring and certainly underpowered Japanese chess game started at number 16 and dropped to position 24. Apparently we were about the only players who opted to buy this sad game. (It's probably a difference in culture.)

So where does Nintendo go from here? It appears that they are going to coast for a couple of months as there are no new games scheduled to come out for about 60 days. There has been no hype or new screen shots in the Japanese magazines for Nintendo's second batch of games like Mario Kart R, Star Wars or Cruis'n USA and one would guess that having done the required official Japan-first launch, Nintendo would now have to start cranking on getting the half million systems and games ready for the scheduled U.S. launch on Sept. 30.

Meanwhile, in the U.S. the sales of the grey market N64 import machine are brisk despite very limited quantities and an unusually high $699+ price (plus shipping) being charged in some stores. Also, Nintendo of America is being unusually quiet this time around about any potential U.S. game compatibility problems that we might eventually encounter if our players jump the gun and buy the Japanese N64 system. Hmmm.

Bottom line: It's still too early to see if the N64 will become the dominant game system in Japan. The only thing I know for sure is that I'm having the most fun l've had in years playing Super Mario 64. It's like 1991 all over again when I spent three weeks playing Super Mario World. Good job Mr. Miamoto!

The holiday shopping season is rapidly approaching and this time, it looks like it is going to be a banner year.

Now that all the systems are below the $200 threshold (Nintendo just announced a drop in price from $259 to $199), the big three are planning on selling everything that they can get in from Japan. Already there are spot shortages of both PlayStations and Saturns here in Chicago and the official shopping season is still a whole month away. As for getting an N64? Good luck. You had better have placed a preorder (even though there appears to be only two carts out at launch), the buzz about Mario is so hot that it'll carry the system until NoA decides to release a second batch of games.

As for the other guys, Sega has a couple of arcade sequels and the new Sonic disc to help drive sales, while Sony has Crash, Twisted Metal 2, WipeOut XL, a long list of RPGs to win back those who thought the Saturn was the RPG system and a whole series of hot sports games to entice players to upgrade from their 16-Bit system.

Who will be the winner come January? That's easy. Sony is comfortably ahead now and they aren't looking back. They are rapidly filling in the previously empty niche holes' in their game inventory and the PlayStation seems to have no weaknesses. While each of the three systems will sell well, Nintendo can't get enough systems to the U.S., and there just aren't enough AAA rated Saturn-only games to put Sega first in the system race. But, second or third isn't necessarily bad especially when each company. worldwide, will have millions of systems in the homes (and the race is far from over). The best advice: Look at the games coming out for each of the systems and go with the one that has the most titles that interest you.

In other news, information is slowly beginning to leak out from the Nintendo licensees in Japan. Seta was one of the first companies with early pictures of their golf, helicopter and racing carts. Kemco is starting to talk as is Konami and Square. Nintendo of Japan should be bringing out some of their second tier of titles as early as this month with Wave Race leading the pack and Mario Kart and Kirby a month or so later. However here in the States we might not see these games until late this year.

Lastly, our sources in Japan have been noticing that Virtua Fighter 3 has been appearing on test at various Sega arcades. We're on our way to JAMMA (the main Japanese arcade show) so watch for a hands-on review in the next issue. Also we've been hearing rumors of Street Fighter 3 coming ® out in December (with the home versions due sometime in summer 1997), so this could finally be the world debut of the long-, long-, long-anticipated SF3. Or will Capcom chicken out and do a Street Fighter Alpha 3? Also, where does that leave the third major playerNamco? They have been very quiet the last few months and that could just mean that Tekken 3 is about ready. Needless to say, this could be the arcade show of the decade.

No matter what, we'll be there and if you're even remotely interested in arcade games, you won't want to miss our November issue where JAMMA and two other trade shows will be spotlighted with exclusive pictures and information.

It's trade show time again, and with three major worldwide events occurring in a 30-day period, our editors have been out of the office more than in. We've spent the bucks and fought the crowds to make it easier for you to see the very latest in gaming. This issue, in fact, packs in over 100 new home and arcade previews, including the very first pictures of the long-awaited Street Fighter III. But I'm getting ahead of myself

The Tokyo Game Show gives us an advance look at the new Nintendo 64, PlayStation and Saturn games that will be coming out next year. Perhaps the best part of the show was having the ability to actually play the first generation of Japanese Nintendo 64 third-party games. While we've run pictures in the past, being able to play the carts gives us an idea as to how well the Japanese N64 developers will be able to fully utilize the advanced capabilities of the N64 (not bad, but we've seen similar products on the PlayStation).

We then moved on to ECTS in London to see what is happening on the other side of the ocean. Apparently, the Brits have really been making progress in PlayStation and Saturn programming as some of the new titles such as Ninja from Core (Eidos) and Tunnel B1 from Team 17 (Ocean) are setting new standards in game development. Other new sneak peeks that we got included a completely revamped Pitfall 3-D, MechWarrior 2 (Activision), The Crow (Acclaim), Speed King (Konami) and Spider (BMG) and the new '97 sports games from EA.

Three days later we had to be in Tokyo for the number-one arcade show in the world-JAMMA. And what a show it was! As mentioned earlier, Capcom realty brought out their big guns with a playable Street Fighter EX (used to be SF Infinity, Gaiden, 3-D or a half dozen other code names), X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, Red Earth and a short three-minute trailer at the end of their demo tape of none other than the mysterious Street Fighter III which will be running on their new updated CP-System 3 CD hardware!

There was other news at the show. Sega had dozens of playable Virtua Fighter 3 games and you won't want to miss Sushi-X's review of this long-awaited coin-op. In addition, now that Sega is getting into arcade/amusement parks, they had to have their own jet ski and skiing games. They certainly wouldn't want to have their competitor's machines (Namco) in a Sega park.

Konami had the other major announcement. To everybody's surprise, they had brand-new hardware which appeared to rival, if not surpass, Sega's Model 3 arcade architecture. Running with a dual Power PC chip configuration, Konami captivated the show attendees with a long tape demo of perhaps the most fluid looking 3-D polygon fighting game ever. Granted the book is still out on this, as there have been great-looking demos before, and Konami is not exactly known for producing the best fighting games, but if-and it still is an if-this is the M2 hard-ware, Matsushita may just have the best game system yet especially when it can equal if not surpass the capability of Sega's Model 3 board-something which the Saturn, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 can't do.

More next month.

As we begin this holiday season, the biggest question we hear from our readers is: With all the new systems out, which one should I buy? A reasonable request, and something we hear every year at this time. Of course, many of the answers can be obtained from the 1997 EGM Buyer's Guide which is out on newsstands now. In that issue our review crew did a lot of the basic homework for youthey evaluated and rated all the new systems.

Still, just because of the volatile nature of our industry, there are a lot of rumors floating around. Most of them are just speculation, disguised with a few assumptions.

One of the best rumors is the fact that the PlayStation is going down in price. This is not unreasonable, since it has been dropping over the last year. But in this case, Sony executives have stated that there is no reason to lower it further. They are number one with the best software library and the best reputation. And the systems are selling at a record pace. They admit that Nintendo sold out quickly, but then so did the Sega CD. Bottom line, expect the $199 price to stick for some time.

Another good rumor is that the Saturn is dead, and Sega is getting out of the hardware business. Again, these are partial truths. While the sales numbers in the U.S. are not keeping up with Sony's, Sega's best season is now, partially because this is the time they bring out all their big software titles, such as Virtua Cop 2, Virtua On, Daytona Champ.: Circuit Edition, Mr. Bones etc., all of which are games that you can't play on any other system. Are they getting out of the hardware business? No one knows for sure, but remember, as bleak as it may look in the States, the Saturn is ruling in Europe and is right up there with Sony in Japan. A price drop in the U.S. would increase sales, but nothing appears imminent.

And what about Nintendo? They certainly made a big splash at launch, but unfortunately, they can't make enough systems fast enough to keep up with the demand. Expect major shortages for quite some time. That's not all that bad, as their software lineup is going to need time before it increases to any size-able amount. This is nothing new, though, as the launch of the Super NES was done the same way, with very few titles to start. Still, if you find a N64, buy it just to play Mario.

One additional important note. Don't forget to cast your vote for Game of the Year. The official form is in between pages 34 and 35. This year we are changing the way many of the best of the year' awards are being determined. In the past, the awards were determined by the editors of our magazines and announced in the Buyer's Guide. This year we are waiting for finished copies of all this year's games then merging the readers' top picks in with those of the EGM editors. The results will be published in the March issue of EGM.

Finally, for the first time that I can recall, we have a tie for the Game of the Month. It's not a misprint, both Tomb Raider (PlayStation) and Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Saturn) tied with the highest cumulative score. Also note that our Review Crew Editor's Choice awards have changed from Platinum and Gold to Gold and Silver.

90,It Is Your Des-s-s-stiny,"
It was about 20 years ago today, but it wasn't a rock-n'-roll band that generated all the excitement.

My grandma and grandpa brought over this amazing new machine that you plugged into the back of the TV and were able to actually move the little rectangular white images on the screen. The dawn of home video games had arrived, in the form of a game called Pong.

My brother and I were mesmerized. We didn't move from the couch that first day for five or six hours straight, staring at the TV screen, immersed in the interaction.

About the same time, by fate or not, an unassuming sci-fi movie called Star Wars hit theaters, and went on to change Hollywood forever. The film captured our imaginations,; the story somehow touched the human spirit in each of us. Perhaps most of all, its special effects dazzled our senses. It was the first time that many of us could believe in a fantasy, because it all looked, and sounded, so real.

In 1997, Star Wars truly is bigger than ever and Lucasfilm is poised to usher in a historic new era. At the heart of this brilliantly coordinated initiative is (besides the Force) an unprecedented rerelease of the movies in theaters next month, with amazingly updated visual and sound effects.

When we look back at this historic moment in Star Wars lore, however, the release of Shadows of the Empire for the Nintendo 64 may prove to be as significant a milestone for video games as Star Wars has been for movies. George Lucas' epic has already had a profound influence on the video game industry. Many of the 20- and 30-something creative geniuses who populate the video game industry today sport Star Wars toys, posters or books in their cubicles, on their shelves or near their computers.

Perhaps it is appropriate then, 20 years later, that these two mediums would converge to generate what may be the ultimate destiny for both of them.

Video games are also on the cusp of a renaissance. The year 1996 was a transition for our industry, and in 1997, growing numbers of enthusiasts will make the switch from the 16- to 32- and 64-Bit platforms. One game, heck, one level, is going to help accelerate this transition.

There's a stage in the Nintendo 64 Shadows of the Empire game that breaths life into this ultimate fantasy. On the Ice Planet Hoth level, during the attack of the Rebel Base scene, you are in the movie. You are flying a snowspeeder for the Rebel Alliance, and you are there, defending the power generator from AT-AT Walkers to Imperial Probe Droids. You have complete freedom of movement in a 3-D environment, and the graphics move as fast as the movie scenes.

It is the first time I have ever experienced this in any video game: home OR arcade (some readers will readily point out that Alien Trilogy for the PlayStation was the first to break into this realm, but that game, while extremely cool, was basically a reverse-engineered Doom clone). This one level in Shadows, I believe, marks a hugely significant milestone in the annals of both mediums.

Where does this lead us? Will the interactive element become as important as sound, or bluescreens? Will people actually control Schwarzeneggar's Terminator-blasting his way through a shopping mall? Will flying a Federation Starship be so real it will make the weak-stomached queasy? Will major producers, directors and studios start considering the interactive element during every phase of moviemaking?

The answer is yes, and the promise of things to come is exhilarating. For, as Han Solo would say, Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy.

And playing Pong isn't like piloting a Snowspeeder. The future is here, and Shadows of the Empire for the Nintendo 64 gives us a glimpse of the possibilities.

We're back from Nintendo of Japan's major game event: the annual Shoshinkai show. As I look back on it, in many ways this show was a lot like last year's event. Both started with a lot of preshow rumors and ended with the disappointing reality of Nintendo doing things in their usual slow, careful way.

Disappointing? Yes and no. As a journalist, I always want to see what is new and unannounced and being able to play only three games was quite a letdown. But knowing how Nintendo works, 1 never really expected them to open up their R&D labs to the press. Still, Zelda and the disk drive were supposed to be the key items at the show and that was the disappointing part. Other than 10 seconds of quick shots of Zelda on a prepared Nintendo demo tape, that was it. And the disk drive? All we were allowed to see was a very strange demo of a rotating cube with the audience's faces digitized on it (which supposedly was running through the disk drive). As for other Nintendo N64 games, about the only peek into the future was again, just what was on the tape. Yoshi, Kirby and 007 were all there, but, unfortunately, if you blinked, you would have missed the major portion of the game that was being shown. A couple of the U.S.-developed games like Cruis'n and KI Gold (which were finished and on their way to the stores) were nowhere to be seen. Other rumored games like F-Zero 2 and Donkey Kong 64 didn't even make it on the tape.

But that's Nintendo. As Mr. Yamauchi said last year, Nintendo will do things their way, and they will not be influenced by anything or anyone. As we saw again, that certainly is true.

The three games that we did get to play were exceptional. Mario Kart 64 (of which we were able to get a production copy by deadline time and still get it in this issue) brings back all the fun of the original Super NES cart and adds the special features that only the N64 can deliver.

BlastDozer is a strange type of game where you can have lots of fun just destroying things. It's hard to describe but once you start playing you are hooked.

StarFox 64, like Mario Kart, will be one hot product. With extremely intense ground and air battles, this game will sell systems!

The rest of the show was devoted to Nintendo's licensees. Neither Square nor Namco were there and Capcom had nothing to say regarding the N64. Seta, Konami, Hudson and 20 more third-party software companies had a total of 40 new Japanese N64 games to show or talk about. All of which were in our exclusive Shoshinkai coverage last month.

Speaking of exclusives, this issue we were able to get a lot of quality footage on Namco's top-secret Tekken 3 quarter-muncher (it isn't expected to officially debut until the Japan show later this spring). Don't expect this type of coverage anywhere else in the world!

Talking about world exclusives, we did get direct footage of Capcom's Street Fighter Ill from another arcade show we attended. In this issue you'll find four pages of pictures and info in our exclusive update.

So you got a brand-new PlayStation for Christmas? | bet it probably either took a fair amount of time to save up the
$200 or it took a lot of convincing to get your parents to spring for another game system. And now that you have it, you're probably telling everybody that it is a lot better than the old 16-Bit system that you finally retired. So other than buying a few new games and an occasional peripheral t bet you think everything is set for the next few yearsright?

Well, you might want to take this sitting down. The rumors are starting to circulate throughout the industry that there might be a new version of the PlayStation coming out. Perhaps as soon as the second quarter of next year in Japan!

While rumors like this are common in our industry, technology has been advancing so fast that three or four years is about the lifespan of a product. Considering that the PlayStation came out in 1994 in Japan (about one year earlier than in the U.S.), the system is starting to show its age.

In that time period not only has memory price dropped considerably, but so has the speed of faster CD-ROM drives. These are two areas where the PlayStation is lacking Imagine having a new system with a 6X or 8X drive (faster than Nintendo's yet unreleased magnetic drive) and another two to four megabytes of internal memory. Developers tell us that the PlayStation's existing memory is already hindering some of the new projects that they want to do and just a few more megs would really open up the system. Imagine being able to morph in Mortal Kombat at the speed of a cartridge (almost) and not having to wait for the machine to access the new data or, in a worst case scenarioaccess the data three to four times faster than now.

Best of all, and it is only speculation at this point, Sony just might be able to make the new system backwards compatible with the one we presently own. That's the good news but it's not much help when there is a step-up system selling for $299 and many of the new games will only be able to be played on the new system.

Would Sony really try bringing out a new system and possibly jeopardize the comfortable lead that they now enjoy over Sega and Nintendo? They probably would do it in Japan as the system race over there is a lot closer than it is here. And Japan always does what they want to anyway. Unfortunately that would be the signal that in the next year (1999) the new system would be coming out here in the U.S.

If that would happen, imagine what the PlayStation sales would be during the holidays of that year. It could be bleak but to offset it the price of the existing system could be set a lot lower than now, perhaps near the $100 price point especially now that Sony has done some major consolidation of most of the circuitry and chips on the current Japanese PlayStation.

It isn't just the PlayStation that could be upgraded in the near future. Sega has let the unofficial word out that their Virtua Fighter 3 (or possibly any of the Model 3 board games) will not work on the Saturn without an added heavy duty memory cartridge. This, plus the fact that Sony just could bring out a better system BEFORE Sega, could possibly get Sega to make the jump to a new system first.

Of course this is all speculation. Neither Sony nor Sega (in Japan) has officially announced anything nor have they hinted that the new system rumors are even partially true.

The clock is ticking though, and as the 32-Bit systems approach their third birthday (in Japan) later this year, everybody has to prepare for the inevitable day (the 1998 Spring PlayStation Show in Japan?) that Sony shows prototypes of the PlayStation 2.

Look at the bright side. If you set $10 aside every month starting now you ought to have the money ready when the new system hits the stores.

And you thought that the new PlayStation that you got for Christmas would be around forever! Sorry Alice this ain't Wonderland!

Sega has just announced that there has been another series of layoffs at the home of the hedgehog. This is the second such leaning down in less than one year, and this is leading to a whole new series of rumors about Sega's future. While anything can happen in the next few months, staff who still have jobs there appear optimistic about Sega staying in the video game business. And why not? Sales of the Saturn were strong last Christmas, as Sega finally found the hook (free games) that was needed to get gamers to buy the system. Now all Sega has to do is find a way to increase the number of games in their software library. With rapidly rising costs of producing games, many developers are looking at the PlayStation and PC as the satest way to invest their buaget Nabbing a few key games, like a street Fighter Ill or MKIV as Saturn-only exclusives, would go a long way to show everybody that Sega is serious about staying in the hardware and software business in the United States. The bottom line is that it is still too premature to go and list your system and games in the want ads.

About Nintendo? According to the sales figures that they are talking about, it seems that Nintendo of America can do no wrong. About the only thing that is slowing them down is that they can't get enough quality software into the marketplace fast enough to keep their hardware sales moving. But that is America. In Japan it is just the opposite. Having lost both Square (Final Fantasy VIl) and Enix (Dragon Quest 7) to Sony's PlayStation, coupled recently with a series of not-too-revolutionary software from their so-called elite group of third-party developers, the Nintendo 64 has quickly dropped out of favor with the Japanese game players. Nintendo has gone through droughts before, and they will surely spring back when StarFox comes out, but there is a much larger problem on the horizon. As previously mentioned, Nintendo is counting on the revolutionary 64?D disk drive to jump one step ahead of the CD-based game systems.

Unfortunately, Nintendo miscalculated the speed at which 6X and 8X CD drives would drop in price, so now when they finally launch their DD, they could be up against a new PlayStation, fully backward compatible, that will equal if not exceed the disk access time and memory capacity of Nintendo's disks. And as games become more complex, feature more CG and require multiple CDs for each game, it will be very hard for Nintendo to win back the Squares and Enixes, let alone keep the developers they have. Couple that with a very high apparent cost for cartridge memory and Nintendo has some serious thinking to do before next Christmas. Already they are slashing game prices in Japan down to the $60 and $50 range, just to stay competitive with Sony's and Sega's CD games.

Finally there is Sony. The company that came from nowhere in a few short years became number one in the video game business. All isn't well though in PlayStation land. Losing key executives not once but several times is not helping Sony keep their focus on the game mar-ket. By not looking back over their shoulder, they let Nintendo get a foothold in the marketplace. If they want to stay number one, Sony will really have to work hard to slow the Nintendo 64's growth in the U.S.

Who's going to win? That's the beauty of this industry-no one knows! Analysts will make projections, editors will make seat-of-the-pants opinions. (Who me? Never!) And players will banter back and forth praising their system, its specs and game library. But again, with the proper marketing plan, enough financial backing and a killer exclusive new game line-up, any of the big three could wind up on top when the numbers come in at the end of the year.

In other news, if you haven't yet scanned through the magazine, check out our new Review Crew section and the revised Tricks section. One thing that has always bothered us here is the fact that there just wasn't enough room to fully review each game. After kicking around ideas, I think we have the ultimate solution. Our Tricks section is now tighter, and we can pack in even more tricks, tips and codes than ever before. In addition, we now have better paper quality and our screen shots are vastly improved. But this is only the beginningwait till next month. By the way, have you found our April Fool's joke in this issue? Also, let me know what you like or dislike. Send me an e-mail.

The video game system price war has started. Nintendo, seeing its N64 system sales declining in Japan, has decided to lower the system price to around $140. One week after this announcement, Sony had a news conference where they stated that the U.S. PlayStation price would be $149.

Could it just be a coincidence that both major players decided to lower the price at the same time or was there something else going on?

It depends on who you talk to.

In our discussions with Sony, they state that this is all part of their long-term marketing plan, and they aren't reacting to what Nintendo did.

In Japan, we hear the same story from Nintendo.

Who do you believe?

While the truth will never come out, our sources have found out that Sony has indeed been planning this price reduction for a long time, and Nintendo of Japan somehow found out about it. Rather than wait until E in June, Nintendo decided to counter quickly with a matching price drop to $149 in North America-obviously, it was just a matter of time.

With the top two players in the industry trading body blows like power wrestlers, we wonder: What will it take-for either Sony or Nintendo-to regain the upper hand? First, Sony can drop the PlayStation price even further to $129 (which they can, and were planning to do all along). When that hap-pens, Nintendo may be able to respond with a $149 price AND include Super Mario 64. However, considering how conservative Nintendo is, they probably will stop at $149 without a cart.

What about Sega? It appears that they are between a rock and a hard place. The circuitry in their system is not as consolidated as the other two are, and any further price drop will really hurt them. Still, they will have to match the others at $149 as their old three-free-game offer just won't be enough to keep them competitive. E3 should be the time when it all comes out but keep reading Q-Mann's column, as he gets the information months before the other mags do.

In other news, I want to thank everybody who e-mailed me with your comments about the magazine. Many of your suggestions are already in the works and you should start seeing them later this year. I am also very pleased that virtually everybody liked the change we made to the design of the Review Crew pages. One problem I always had-and this goes all the way back to issue number 2-is the fact that there never was enough space to fully review a game. While the four-person Review Crew format is the only way to go, having four equal spaces just wasn't quite right. Many times everybody said the same thing, and 80 words never was enough to fully explain the good and bad points of a game. This led to numerous questions, not only from our readers but also the game companies, as to why we gave a game a certain score.

Now, in our current design, one reviewer-usually the one who has the most experience with the game-has the space to really speak his mind. Nothing is held back, and, as in the past, you get the only unbiased, uncensored review of the real game. I say real because, as some of you pointed out, our reviews are not necessarily the first you will see in the magazines. We take great pains to only review FINAL CODE games. That is, no Japanese games, no beta discs, no near-finished discs with qualifying letters from companies-just real reviews of the same games which you will buy in the stores. Plus, as you've also pointed out, our reviews aren't all 10s or to put it in other numbers smiling 5.0s or over-inflated 98s just to keep the advertisers happy.

In addition, our Review Crew is made up of real hardcore players. They take their job very seriously and most impor-tantly, they aren't hiding behind fake, artificial caricature sketches with hokey made-up names. (OK, Sushi-X is an exception, but at least he's a real guy.)

Finally, the positive response to our free pack-in posters has been phenom-enal. It must be a good idea as others have already started to copy us, but wait until you see what we have lined up next! Until then, check out the two-page gatefold Lost World miniposter on pages 99 and 100 in addition to the WCW poster packed in the bag.

Why is Mario 64 such a great game? Odds are you either said that is has spectacular gameplay or you said that it was because of the creative genius of Mr. Miyamoto. Both answers are correct and lead into this month's editorial: Why aren't all games extraordinary games?

Certainly there are a lot of variables, ranging from the original concept (some games should never have been started), to the layout and design (a game should be challenging but not impossible nor too easy), to the capabilities of the artists, designers and programmers (the greatest idea done wrong is still a bad game) and finally to the capabilities of the hardware (the more machine memory and game memory the better). The last element in the recipe for perfection is a Miyamoto, or a Yu Suzuki-a project leader who has that imaginative flair for making sure the game is fun to play.

Do such people exist in the U.S.? Yes. While very few in number, these people are the unsung heroes-the true game gurus. They have been in the business for quite a while; have worked their way up the ranks; and have left their mark on the industry with some of the most revolutionary and best-selling games of our time.

So why haven't we heard more about them? After all, if you open up any Japanese game magazine, there will almost always be something written about Miyamoto or Suzuki.

We've tried to do an article on these visionaries, but the companies have always been very reluctant to let us start talking about any one person in particular. Granted, a good game is a team project, but when was the last time you saw pictures of the staff working for Miyamoto?

Games are created a lot differently in the U.S. than in Japan, though. Over here many times the programming is done by one company, the art by another, the overall coordination by the developer and the publishing by yet another. When only one person is singled out, there can be a lot of resentment among the staff, and relationships get strained. It's the game that ultimately suffers when the chemistry isn't right. Right or wrong, that's the way things are done. It doesn't matter that CEOs get all the credit if a company does well (or poorly) because of the staff's efforts. Down at the working level, the product manager who guides and shapes the team's efforts daily must remain in obscurity.

Of course, the obvious reason why these talented people are kept out of the limelight is because of the old law of supply and demand. With not more than a dozen golden boys in the game industry, these wizards are in big demand and companies get very protective of their key people.

Unfortunately, there can't be enough good things said about these superstars other than thank you for giving us the great games that you managed. Industry politics prevent me from naming everybody specifically, but if l mention Shiny, Iguana, Nintendo R & D Sony San Diego, Universal/Capcom R & D, Crystal Dynamics, E A Sports and SingleTrac, you can read between the lines. Hopefully one day in the near future we can do an article on the true story behind the games that we play.

In other news, I am looking for some specific information from our readers regarding the posters we are packing in with each issue of EGM.

1) What do you think of the posters we have run so far?
2) Of the genres that we have runmech, movie/game or girlwhich did you like and want to see more of?
3) Or, is there another category which we should tryanime, cartoon, comic book etc?
4) If posters aren't that exciting, what about premiums like stickers or decals?
5) In the past we ran minidigest-size individual game strategy guides. What are your thoughts on these?
6) Or, is all of this unnecessary and we should just add another dozen pages or so to the magazine?

Your comments are appreciated and I will personally read each letter. My e-mail address is listed above and the 1920 Highland magazine address is to the right in the masthead.

Thanks for all of you who have been writing to me with your comments about the magazine and enjoy this issue as we really packed a lot of new pre-E3 game info into it.

After discovering the not-so-secret (nor publicized) document from 3Dfx to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), our editors immediately got on this story and started dig-ging. In this Intent of Public Offering (IPO), 3Dfx had to disclose (to some extent) all of the deals they were working on. One of which was a multimillion-dollar project to create a custom version of their popular PC Voodoo graphics accelerator card for Sega's ..upcoming video game system

New game system? Yes. Code named Dural (after the Boss in the Virtua Fighter games), the new Sega 64-Bit system could be in the stores in Japan as early as 1998.

Of course, Sega of Japan, Sega of America and 3Dfx all refused to comment beyond what was revealed in the IPO, but that is where our editors start-ed. A lot of the information we got was obtained from companies who have already been contacted by Sega to start developing games next year for Dural. While the system is far from being com-plete, the specs and, more importantly, the thought process of how the system is to work looks very promising.

Hopefully the one thing that Sega has learned from all of its past game systems (both failures and successes) is that they can't work in a vacuum. It probably is very frustrating for the staff in America not to know what Sega of Japan is going to do next.

From the third-party developers we talked to most have stated that one reason why they aren't doing Saturn games is the lack of support and cooperation with Sega. For instance, the newest program libraries (the ones that do the best tricks with the Saturn) are not being given out by Sega of Japan. Instead, the developers have to either invest sizeable amounts of time and effort to learn on their own how to do the new tricks or to go and compromise their goals as to how they want their game to come out. Or, as in many instances these days, not to even bother to do a Saturn version at all and stick with PlayStation and PC. When that happens, nobody wins. The end result is where Sega is now-in a quality-not-quantity-of-games attitudemeaning that there is a decreasing number of dedicated Saturn third-party developers in the U.S. and Sega is relying more and more on the arcade conversions from its R&D headquarters in Japan. I guess they have no choice since there isn't a U.S. Saturn development group any more (not that they did anything spectacular anyway).

The problems weren't limited to only software development. Who can forget the infamous Sega CD and 32X systems?

The thread that ties all of Sega's problems together is support and coopera-tion. The 32X could have worked if only Japan had given the hardware support to the companies who wanted to do games for it. There now would be more companies doing Saturn development if Japan would be more responsive to the developers' software needs. And if Japan would share more of the information that it has learned about the way the two processors in the Saturn work, we might now be seeing games that are so revolutionary that players wouldn't even think about buying a PlayStation or Nintendo 64.

So where are we with Dural? Maybe just maybeSega of Japan is beginning to see the light. By using the soon-to-be U.S. standard in graphics chips, perhaps the U.S. developers will actually want to start making games for Sega's new system. Add in both 3Dfx's and Microsoft's new programming interfaces and guess what, a conversion from a hot PC game to the new Dural system will be virtually a push of a button away. That means reduced conversion costs for the developer (i.e., more games from third-party developers) and the Dural version would be the first one in the stores (not like the months of waiting for a Saturn conversion now.

All that leaves Sega to do is design the hardware properly. By being able to decide on what the system will actually consist of (and cost) and then to start consolidating the circuitry early on, if not even up front before the Dural comes to market, then Sega would be able to stay ahead of the competition if and when the price wars start between the next generation of systems.

Will it actually happen? Or will Japan repeat history a third time? We can only hope for the best.

For this month's editorial, I think it is a good time to reminisce about how EGM has evolved over the past nine years and how it is going to have to continue to change to remain the leading authority in video game magazines.

Back in the spring of '88 while I was writing a video game column for the Milwaukee Journal, I met up with a young game player (Steve Harris) who had a dream of starting the first magazine about video games. We talked at the summer CES and, sure enough, a couple of months later the first issue of EGM rolled off the presses. Even though it was mostly text with black-and-white pictures, it was still the first magazine devoted entirely to games, and it sold well enough to spawn a second issue.

Why did it work? Being the first certainly helped, but the main goal was to present a fair review of games that were soon to be out in stores. The idea worked, but to us it just wasn't enough. We as gamers and editors wanted more. We added news and previews, and-for the first time-game players could see what games would be coming out in the next few months. Sales took off.

As in any hot market, it didn't take long before other magazines started to appear on the newsstand. We knew we had to evolve-to stay one step ahead of the competition. This was accomplished by getting even earlier news and previews straight from Japan. That was my job-to visit the trade shows and bring back pictures of games that wouldn't be out in the U.S. for six to nine months.

Soon EGM was the magazine to buy, if you wanted the first information about any game. It was fun. My trips to Japan, Hong Kong, England and France really kept me busy, and-coupled with the special features, interviews and news stories that I wrote-the job was a journalist's dream. Also in that time, I was promoted to editor in chief and a lot of administrative responsibilities were added to my schedule. As the magazine's sales improved, the company also grew, and it became harder to get away from my desk. The foreign trade shows still added needed excitement, but there just wasn't enough time to also do game reviews, insightful news stories or any investigative reporting.

Last year Sendai was acquired by Ziff-Davis, and early this year they asked me if wanted to become their full-time on-staff correspondent for all of their video gaming vehicles. It sounded intriguing.

As everybody knows, the internet and all its video game-related sites are growing at a phenomenal rate. Access to game information that is literally minutes old is now the norm. Print media can't compete, and while EGM still leads the pack in getting news first, the information is already stale by Internet standards. Our exclusive stories (see Star Wars: Masters of TerÃ¤s KÃ¤si last month continue to keep EGM on top, but now our competitor's online staff can-and have-just nab an early copy of our magazine, scan the images, reword the text, put it up online and then call it their own work-all before our magazine hits the newsstand (but that's a whole other story).

It is now time for EGM to evolve again. Not only will there be changes as to what and how much game information will be up online, but the magazine itself will be redesigned to focus on areas which will make it unique and vibrant again.

That's where I come in. I have decided to take the chief correspondent position since I will be able to write for all our publications, our Web sites and even ZDTV. This position will allow me to pursue hard-hitting stories, cover trade shows and pen the types of features that a journalist really gets into.

What will happen to EGM? Things probably won't change overnight. One thing I've learned is that there is no one person who makes or breaks a publica-tion. When Steve left, the magazine didn't die. The editor in chief, while important, gives direction and focus to the maga-zine, but it is the entire staff who works for him that should get the credit for a job well done. It has been fun guiding the magazine, and now I am looking forward to guiding the Net, TV and other new Ziff-Davis ventures.

98,There Are Two Big Reasons Why Lara's Become a Star,"
OK, OK, I know we're going to get a ton of questions and e-mails about our Lara Croft coverage the last two months. Just what is going on here? Are the single guys on the staff not dating enough? Did we not put enough saltpeter in the EGM staff's water supply?

Our reasons are obvious. She's hot. Readers are interested in her. Sports Illustrated doesn't quit covering Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls halfway through the playoffs because it's already been done. You cover a star when it's shooting.

After just one installment in what will surely become a truckload of games featuring her, Lara Croft has become the first lady of video games.

How did this happen? It's simple really-Lara is the proud owner of a pair of assets that have been the key to her success. And they're not as obvious as you think.

First is the depth of Lara's char-acter. A lot of it has to do with details, hats off to Eidos for sweating them. In Tomb Raider, Lara displayed an unprecedented variety of moves and animations that gave her an almost lifelike quality. Lara finds herself hanging from cliffs, jumping over broken bridges and taking on a T-Rex. She's also tough. She's athletic. She's got a can-do mentality. And, don't underestimate this, you can see her quite clearly, and learn a lot by just looking at her-you can roughly determine her age, her skin tone, her height, her weight, her eye color, her hair style, her dress size and even her bra size. It's a tried-and-true Hollywood formula: The more the audience feels like they know the hero, the more people will care for her (or him). With Lara, Eidos has pushed the envelope in video game character development.

The second ingredient is the game she debuted in. Tomb Raider cemented a new genre of video game that is something of a cross between a shooter, an action game and an RPG. In the copycat mentality of entertainment, TR was a refreshing change, and gamers loved it. A few earlier games attempted the 3-D format in console games Out of This World, Fade to Black), but the unprecedented fluidity and gameplay of TR established it as a dynamic and permanent new game genre as the evolution of video games continues.

Add these two components together, and Lara Croft represents a classic example of thinking outside the box. Eidos has tapped into a fresh vein of excitement, and in addition to the huge economic reward they have reaped as a result, they have also earned a salute from us here at EGM for taking chances.

Now, let's get to the question I know most of you were wondering about: How much does Lara's super-human measurements feed into this frenzy? Well, it's no secret we're in a testosterone-rich indus-try. If some guys get a little extra something out of a game by controlling a character because theyuh, like the arrangement of her polygons, that's their busi-ness-we'd rather not know about it. It's one of the undeniable and recognizable details of Lara, but unlike Pamela Anderson Lee, by no means is it the sole reason for her celebrity.

As for parents who are in fear that their kids are going to want to control Barbie-doll-type heroines in every future video game they play, I wouldn't worry too much. It's no stranger than controlling an Italian midget plumber or a sneaker-wearin' marsupial. That's the point: Video games are about an escape to somewhere, something and sometimes someone else.

Trick or treat! BOO! Were you scared? Probably not. Nowadays it's hard to frighten die-hard gamers thanks to a huge, desensitizing influx of horrific, gory games. Titles like Resident Evil, Nightmare Creatures, Clock Tower, Enemy Zero and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night all promote and glorify gore, horror and the basics of human dismemberment. Is this the culmination of years of video game censorship finally being relaxed? Well if so, it couldn't have come at a better time, because this Halloween will be full of chills and thrills from beyond the grave. What would be more fun than curling up with Clock Tower at 1 a.m., in the dark, with all traces of ambient sounds muffled by your screams as you round the corner right into Scissorman? That's the stuff nightmares are made of. Take a look at this month's Halloween feature to get a ghastly gander at this year's scarefest.

2-D Revisited
For months, awesome games like Mega Man 8 and X4 were given the shaft for being old and two-dimensional. Now-surprise! -2-D games dominate the new release charts. like Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, Herc's Adventures and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. True 3-D games are rare this holiday season, as the industry takes a step back and realizes that 2-D isn't dead-not by a long shot. In fact, you can count the new 3-D titles-mostly for the Nintendo 64 on your fingers.

Softer Censors?
Another noticeable aspect of the gaming evolution is censorship, or the softening thereof. Games like Final Fantasy VII and Wild Arms now contain mild profani-ties. These characters really talk trash! The fact that this dialog has made it into the production U.S. version of FFVIl is a subtle, if not significant victory for anti-censor-ship. It's not a stretch to forecast that as game screen resolutions improve, and a butt-crack looks more like a butt-crack, that we'll soon be dealing with issues of nudity. Still, it should be no surprise that the industry's shifting gears and rewing up for the future. As technology races for-ward, so must the developers, marketers, gamers and media.

Chasing the Edge
As game developers continue to push the envelope, we, as a magazine covering the industry, understand and endorse the need for change. Change is good. And in four short weeks, you'll be holding the most evolved video game reporting vehicle of all time-our 100th issue. In all these years with EGM, I never thought I'd be around to witness this event, let alone write the last two-digit editorial. I've had the ultimate pleasure of working with the most dedicated bunch of gamer/editors I've ever known, from Steve Harris, Ed Semrad, Martin Alessi, John Stockhausen, Terry Minnich and Sushi-X, right up to the new brilliant staff of writers: Joe Funk, Crispin Boyer, Dan Hsu, Shawn Smith, Kraig Kujawa, John Ricciardi, Kelly Rickards, Scott Parus and Dean Hager, not to mention all the other staff members working behind the scenes, like our art directors, copy-editors, circulation and administration staffs. The hard work of these individuals, and the support of you, the reader, has made the past 99 issues a joy to create.

At this crossroads, I am proud, yet sad, to close the doors on one era of EGM, and look ahead to the future.Thanks everyone!

One hundred issues is a lot of work, but we've never lost sight of the fact that when you're writing about video games, churning out 100 issues is a lot of fun.

EGM has changed so much in the last eight years, and yet remains deeply rooted in the ideals it was borne out of: passion and integrity. Steve Harris grew this magazine out of a little-or-no-profit fanzine that he published out of a labor of love. During EGM's rise to the top, we've retained those simple ideals and never let ourselves get caught up in the pressures or criticisms that come with publishing a category-leading magazine.

When the magazine launched in 1989, EGM quickly established itself as being the first to publish screen shots and information on the newest games. It was the tenacity of Steve and Ed Semrad that made it happen, and enthusiasts quickly recognized EGM as the premier source for breaking information and honest reviews by gaming enthusiasts.

In the last eight years, we've taken shots from several major game companies as well as competitors accusing us of whatever, when the only thing we have ever done is tell it like it is. The evolution continued when Ziff-Davis bought us last year. The cornerstone of their publishing model is Content is King, and we couldn't agree more it's been a perfect fit. Today we proudly stand and present to you a magazine that has always truly been by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts.

EGM has been blessed with quality people throughout its existence, which is one BIG reason for our success. There's people like Ken Williams, John Stockhausen, Mike Vallas, Terry Minnich and Ed Semad; you can trace their names in EGM back to the first dozen-or-so issues (Ed goes back to #1!). And then there's Dan Hsu (Michigan), Cy Wochok (Illinois), Andrew Burwell (Texas), Crispin Boyer (Florida), Kraig Kujawa (Texas), John Ricciardi (New York), Kelly Rickards (California), Jason Hinman (Michigan), Shawn Smith and Scott Parus (Illinois) who have joined us from all different parts of the country because, first and foremost, they loved gaming and wanted to share their talent and articulate their passion with readers just like them. Finally there's our Publisher Jon Lane, Associate Publisher Jennie Parker and Circ. Director Joan McInerney, who have helped further refine the magazine in so many dynamic ways.

While EGM is in as good of hands as it has ever been, we've always been humble enough to listen to our readers. As we approached milestone 100, we considered your comments, and then took a step back and examined what was good about EGM, and what was not so good.

No doubt EGM has always been a little rough around the edges. But then, so has the video game industry. When EGM launched in the aftermath of late the 198os video game crash, the industry was something akin to comic books in both its budget and public perception. Since then, the industry has grown into a multibillion-dollar beast, and has stepped up into the ranks of motion pictures as a mainstream form of entertainment. If you look back, you can really trace how EGM's design and editorial package has reflected the maturation of the industry throughout the last eight years.

That's why this major redesign of issue 100 is our tribute to you, the readers. You've stuck with us, and now we present to you a publication we feel encompasses the state of the art in video game coverage. We think you'll like the changes, but as always, are anxious to hear your feedback.

So what's in store for the future? Well, who the hell really knows for sure, but in our proud tradition of not being afraid to go out on a limb, here's a few predictions. When issue #200 comes around, the edit team can dust this off, laugh at our ignorance and cast aspersions upon us:

While Al will improve, the best game programmers will recognize there will never be a substitute for a human friend or foe on screen, and more games will take advantage of multiplayer setups.
Games will become more flexible in their Create-a-Player Mode so gamers can better personalize their characters (especially RPGs). The time is not too far off when gamers will be able to scan their own photos and put themselves in games.
Cartridge-based consoles will die offalthough there will still be some Atari 2600 E.T. cartridges lying around.
LBEs will replace the traditional arcade and will rival the popularity of movie theaters in many communities.
We'll finally see the triple threat of a great license, followed by a great movie, followed by a great game (we're hoping it's the Star Wars prequels).
Capitalizing on their reputation and the Walkman name, Sony will roll out a Sony PlayMana portable device that can run PlayStation games.

In last month's editorial, we made some predictions about the future of gaming. Already, one of them has come true. Apparently, we jumped the gun a little bit - a golden gun if you will.

Vegas bookies will tell you hope doesn't mix well with prognostication. Emotion gets in the way. In this case, however, our dreams have become reality.

We predicted, OK hoped, that someone, somewhere, was finally going to tap a great license, make a killer movie and then make a killer game. It's amazing when you consider this has never happened before in our industry. Up until now, the characters in blockbuster video games have all been born there. With all of the great characters and settings and plots provided by Hollywood, not a single movie or movie character has ever enjoyed mega-star status in video games. Not Superman. Not Batman. Not Star Trek. Not Aliens. Not Indiana Jones. Not Terminator. Not Jurassic Park. Not Spawn. Not even Mickey Mouse.

There are some tepid exceptions: Star Wars has consistently been the best so far with many excellent games based on Lucas' universe, but except for the first level on Shadows of the Empire (see EGM #90 editorial), we have not seen a true milestone of a video game based on Star Wars. Alien Trilogy and Die Hard for the PlayStation were actually pretty good games and came close to mimicking the look and feel of their cinematic namesakes, but in both cases the games were just not integrated deeply enough into the film's story line, and neither ever really achieved epic status.

While countless attempts have been made over the last decade to tap this deepest of veins, usually, unfortunately, something gets lost in the translation. Our industry simply has a poor track record of producing quality movie-to-game translations. Companies seem to spend more time and money chasing down and then marketing a big movie license than they do in producing the game. Well, history has taught us repeatedly that simply procuring a license and slapping it on a bad game does not translate into strong sales.

That's where things have dismally stood, but now we're pleased, no ecstatic, to report that a new standard of excellence has been established in movie-to-game adaptations.

His name is Bond, James Bond, and the game is GoldenEye. Nintendo (who published) and Rare (who developed) deserve a 21-gun salute for their fabulous work on this landmark title for the N64. It is the translation we've been longing for at the EGM offices: a great property (James Bond); a great movie (GoldenEye); and a game that truly captures the essence of its namesake.

What makes this game so good? The answer can be summed up in one word: game-play. If GoldenEye was a generic spy game in white packaging with an olive stripe and stenciled letters and titled Jerry's Shootin' Spy Game, it would still be a great game, and Jerry would probably become a character icon like Duke Nukem or Lara Croft. It's infinitely more important that Rare took the time to do this game right than it was to hit the release window of the film. The game is good enough to stand on its own, so the lag between the release of the game and the movie (about 18 months) is insignificant.

Yes, GoldenEye is a Doom-type game. Most of what you see in the game has been in other games. But it is the rock-solid feel, depth of gameplay and integration of so many quality programming components that elevate GoldenEye to elite status. Weave in the GoldenEye story line, steeped with more than three decades of rich Bond tradition; an unmistakable theme song; familiar supporting characters like Q and MoneyPenny; innovative gadgets and exotic settings; and you have a game that is an instant classicnot to mention a milestone for the industry.

Where do we go from here? Hopefully, programmers and developers will learn the lessons Mr. Bond has taught us. We just want to see more, better, movie-to-game translations. Perhaps the next step is an integrated DVD that will include the typical director's cut of a movie, production notes, behind-the-scenes footageand also include the game. In the meantime, thumbs up to Rare and Nintendo for setting a new standard in movie-to-game translations.

With that said, we want to know who's going to step up and come out with the Full Metal Jacket and It's Pat games?

This month, we pay tribute to the founding fathers of our industry, with what may be the most comprehensive timeline ever created to chronicle the history of video games.

As this monster project came together from a variety of sourcesincluding our friends and colleagues at GameSpot, several freelance contributors, our own editors/walking-encyclopedias and art directors plus nostalgic gaming buffs who have immortalized the classics with labor-of-love Web sitesat least two larger patterns emerged from the mosaic of contributors and contributions.

First, it is the reminder that our industry has always been fueled by the twin booster rockets of technology and human imagination in search of a most pure and universal human passion: to have fun. Video games touch the kid in all of us, which explains the undaunting effort and amazing array of contributions from such a diverse background of contributors. From military engineers and officers to pimply teenagers, from Japan to the U.S. to the U.K., the evolution of video games will remain a universal endeavor.

Next, and perhaps less apparent (yet cool) observation about the timeline: It predicts the future! History clearly demonstrates that games will absolutely, positively, continue to get better. From Pong to NHL 98, from Adventure to Final Fantasy VII, from Defender to Colony Wars and from Combat to GoldenEye, the list of examples goes on and on. We as consumers are in the catbird seat as benefactors of all this evolution, and with the ability to play both state-of-the-art stuff and revisit many of those old- time favorites with museum collections of classic games, gaming is undoubtedly better than it has ever been.

It's been an eye-poppin' ride so far, and we at EGM salute the creators, the gamers and all those who have helped build an industry rich with wonderful success stories, fantastic failures and everything in between. While we all endlessly look forward to the next great game, take a fascinating glimpse into the past with us, starting on page 112.

There is an important trend in gaming that's gaining in popularity. Multiplayer gaming has clearly become the catalyst for growth in our industry-GoldenEye 007 and sports titles are among the hottest sellers on the market, and Location-Based Entertainment facilities, or LBEs, are popping up everywhere. We have long since zoomed past the halcyon days of dark, seedy arcade hangouts and lone rebel gaming. Instead, gaming has becomegaspsocially acceptable.

Things haven't always been this social. In my early teens, nothing like LBEs or multiplayer games even existed. Arcades were seedy at best; usually poorly lit, cement-floor caves where I could escape the pressures of adolescence. The older kids smoked while playing a lone game of Space Invaders or Asteroids, their quarters lined up along the bottom of the screen. Arcades were usually crowded, yet there was a distinct lack of conversation. This was a solitary time; a time to be alone with a single goal-defeat the game-not a social gathering on par with school sporting events and mixers. It's no wonder arcades were blamed for the corruption of youth. Even at our best, we looked more like entranced zombies than the future of America.

And then came the home systemstalk about a social placebo! I was one of the shameless statistics, joining a legion of teens frozen for hours, mesmerized by the dazzling graphics and engrossing gameplay of the latest Atari game. Social withdrawal? Certainly. But hey, I was developing hand-eye coordination, right? In hindsight, l'm amazed the FDA didn't move to classify video games as some sort of narcotic. There was no alternative to reaching that 100th round of Defender. Gaming was like a drug, and I, like many of my peers, was addicted for life.

Sports fans have a name for such an intense focus; I was In The Zone. The problem was, being In The Zone was pretty lonely. Gradually, more games began to allow for more than one player at a time. It was the start of something big. Then the first four-player simultaneous titles began to filter into arcades and console systems. Anyone remember Warlords on the Atari 2600 and in the arcades? Now that was a game that required some pals to really enjoy. There suddenly was a social aspect to playing video games.

Fast forward to my late teens, where arcades had undergone a radical transformation. Clean, well-lit game rooms started popping up everywhere. It got to the point where a kid only had to take a short walk to the nearest corner or mall to meet his buddies for a game of four-player Gauntlet or Cyberball. Martial arts games required a human competitor to have the most fun. Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Final Fight and Bad Dudes machines were constantly packed with two friends (or enemies) hacking away at each other. Suddenly, arcade games weren't so much of a rebel, loner pastime anymore. Sure, many of us hunkered down at home at night to enjoy the latest incarnation of Mario, but gaming would never be the same.

Today, home games have once again caught up with arcades in embellishing the human element of video gaming. Now we're playing games like GoldenEye 007, Duke Nukem 3D, Bomberman, Mario Kart 64 and countless sports titles, all of which support-and are arguably at their best inMultiplayer Mode. With the exception of a few genres like RPGs, many games require a friend to realize the full entertainment value. Even here at EGM, we used to grab our favorite titles and hunker down for some serious gaming binges, alone. Now we play sports, various fighting games and racing games as a group. We sometimes even visit the local Dave & Busters for merriment and mayhem.

There's only one thing missing in this pleasant evolution: multiplayer RPGs. With advanced Internet capabilities linking computers worldwide, PCs have had a head start. Breakthrough titles like Diablo, Meridian 59 and recently Ultima Online create virtual communities complete with unique, diverse roles for gamers. Whereas before you were forced to be the lone hero, now you can join a party of real friends, slay a dragon and battle the forces of evil as a team, sharing the glory and bonding of victory, and the humiliation and finger-pointing of defeat. Home consoles are the final frontier for multiplayer RPGs. Final Fantasy VIII Online? We can't wait!

There's no question, the latest trend in gaming requires a little help from your friends

Readers ask us all the time about including a retro-gaming section in EGM. Not the 8-Bit and 16-Bit stuff (heck, a lot of those games still rank as the best of all time-see our Top 100 Games in issue #100), but the ancient relics from before the mid-8os market crash. I'm talking arcade games, plus the very first home systems like Atari 2600, Magnavox, Vectrex, Intellivision, ColecoVision, etc.

It's a question that stirs debate in just about every editor here, but the answer always comes back the same.

Usually, we struggle to find space to cover all the current products being released in our bustling industry. It's not that we're philosophically against covering retro games, it's just that practicality in the form of a finite amount of editorial space dictates our coverage.

We're certainly not against covering gaming's heritage (witness our timeline in EGM #101 and the second part of our History of Arcades in this issue). If it wasn't for games like Pong and Adventure and Defender and Pac Man, we wouldn't be playing the games we are today. No doubt, replaying those old games and reliving those experiences is priceless. But how many of you out there have found that after playing those old games a few times, they just don't have enough depth to hold your interest for very long? You find yourself saying, I spent all that time way back when playing this simple game? Geez, I don't remember my life being that boring.

While hearing the sounds and seeing the sites of a Defender or Centipede stirs the adolescent in all of us and conjures memories of those halcyon days after school at the dimly lit neighborhood arcade, the truth is those warm and fuzzy feelings bend our memories. It's like having the chance to go back and rekindle an old flame more often than not, we'll find we put the other person (or thing) on a pedestal and make him/her/it out to be more than he/she/it really was. It's human nature.

Still, the opportunity to relive a part of our past is priceless. It's a core part of why we all play games in the first place: It makes us feel like kids again, and it's an escape to another time and place. We salute Namco, Midway and anyone else who releases classic games, for they are an indelible part of our industry's heritage, and will always hold a special place in the pantheon of video gaming.

Nonetheless, don't expect a retro-gaming section to show up in the pages of EGM any time soon. It comes down to a simple formula: not enough space. What would you rather have? A four-page preview on Zelda 64 or a three-page preview with a page on games that have been out 20 years? A story on the future of Sega or a focus on 2600 sports games? Technology fuels our industry, and what's next will always be sexier than what was.

While that might be bad news for the retro-buffs among us, the good news is you will be able to find a gradual increase of retro-gaming coverage on our spanking new Web site, videogames.com. Consider this a manifestation of two of EGM's important traits: We listen to our readers, and we respect the history of our industry.

Looking ahead, you can bet that people playing today's generation of games will wax nostalgic about GoldenEve and Colony Wars the way we do now about Adventure, Smurfs and Intellivision Football and Hockey. Time always marches on, and hey, if nothing else, future EICs of EGM can re-use this article by simply replacing the underlined words with the hottest titles of their day.

In last month's editorial and in recent special features (Back to the Future- issue #103 and Video Game Timeline issue #104) we took a brief trip back in time and revisited famous moments in video-game history. But what does the future have in store for us

One of the most eagerly awaited games in quite a while is the upcoming Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time (as it is called in Japanwe'll call it Zelda 64 for now). A lot of us can't help but get excited at the thought of playing a Zelda game on the Nintendo 64. Who could blame us? It's the latest chapter in the long-running series that has captured the hearts of countless gamers. How about a real 32-/64-Bit Sonic game or a Metroid 64? The thought of these hypothetical games is enough to make us drool with anticipation.

Something, however, is the matter here. All of the titles I mentioned are sure to be big hits (with good reason), but is that all the industry can throw at us gamers to get us excited: sequels and rehashes? I'm worried that it might be.

Programmers have settled into a Laz-E-Boy of complacency. They take yesteryear's hits and pump them up with new graphics and sounds, stick in a few new features, and ship them off to the stores. It's the easy thing to do: Game designers can skip racking their brains for original concepts and simply improve upon documented hits.

Hey, I'm not complaining (well, I am complaining, but hear me out). I love Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64. I love Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for the PlayStation. I love Saturn Bomberman for the Saturn. These games are absolutely incredible. But wouldn't you agree with me that they aren't really original? Super Mario 64 is incredible, but it is exactly what l'd expect a Mario game to look like in 3-D. Symphony contains pretty much the same gameplay that every previous Castlevania offered. Saturn Bomberman is the best Bomberman game out there - because it gives us more of the same. These games are all great, but they're all modern updates of past successes.

I do miss the old days-the days when I'd be playing a new and revolutionary game for the first time. I'd be sitting there, amazed as hell at what I was playing. If you were anything like me, you were giddy with excitement when you first played Super Mario Bros. (I still remember thinking how awesome the game was, with its excellent control and plethora of secrets). Same with Intellivision's NFL Football (with the first-ever playbook), Zelda (a magical action-RPG like nothing seen before) and Tetris (do I even need to say why?). Remember seeing Street Fighter Il in the arcade and witnessing Honda's 100-Hand Slap or Dhalsim's Fireball for the first time? (OK, so SFIl is a sequel, but you gotta admit, you've never seen anything like it before.) I remember. I remember playing these games, wide-eyed and jaw-dropped, thinking that whoever made these games were true geniuses.

So I'm sitting here today, playing a great Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha, but my mind fondly wanders off. I think back to my college days when I threw my first Sonic Boom, and I wonder, Am I ever going to be amazed again?

Are all the good and original ideas taken up? Let's hope not. While I'm sure I'll have fun playing the next Mario or Sonic game, I'll eagerly await the next fresh concept that's not based on an older one. Who knows what will be the next game that cannot be classified as a Doom-clone, head-to-head fighter or yearly sports game update? We get a few standouts once in a while, like the entertaining PaRappa the Rapper and Monster Rancher, but these games are too few and far between. We need some innovative game designers to come up with some innovative ideas. We need someone to pleasantly shock and surprise us again.

Is anyone out there up to the challenge?

106,Change is Good,"
As you look through the magazine this month, you may notice one or two changes around here that you won't have seen before. For a startwho the hell is this guy? A new editor in chief? After some considerable time without anyone at the helm of EGM full time, the post is now filledby me. Hello. You may have seen my name discreetly slipped into the masthead last month (I arrived in the States fresh from the U.K. just as our Tekken 3 issue went to press), but this has been my first full month working on the longest-running and best video game magazine in the world.

So are things going to change much around here? Welljust a little and to be honest the changes that will become apparent in the coming months are simply a reflection of the way the game industry is evolving. As has been said before in these editorial pages, as our industry continues to grow at the current startling level, we need to reflect the changes that occur. Financially we are already in the realms of the music industry but as time goes on, I have every faith that video games will continue to mimic the movie industry in terms of both production values and blockbuster release patterns. How long before we see the gaming equivalent of Titanic? Can things change so quickly that we'll see games taking a billion dollars worldwide?

In the meantime though, we're going to see more short-term, but still fairly important moves in the industry. For example, in the coming months we will see Sega re-invent itself with its new machinethe as-yet-unnamed Katana project is scheduled for a Japanese release before the end of the year. Hopefully we'll also see Sega flexing its franchising muscles by announcing products along the lines of the latest incarnation of Sonic or maybe even home versions of Rally 2 and Virtua Fighter 3. Even further down the line, how about House of the Dead 2, Virtua Cop 3 or even Daytona 2? Who knows?

Elsewhere we'll see Nintendo continue to acknowledge the Game Boy as the most successful video game product of all time with yet another revision to the standard package in the shape of the Game Boy Pocket Light. We will also see the Big N make a decision about the global release of the much-anticipated 64DD and any associated game releases. Super Mario 2 anyone?

On top of this, Sony is taking a bold step into the handheld market with the PlayStation memory card-based PDA whilst at the same time actively encouraging both first- and third-party developers to push the envelope with the existing technology. Games using the PlayStation's Hi-res Mode shifting polygons at high frame rates will continue to amaze-pushing the system above and beyond anything that anyone ever expected of it.

Elsewhere both software technology and content issues will be addressed compre-hensively. In this issue alone we have early shots of games that push the envelope technologically on the existing formats: Konami's Castlevania 64, Crystal Dynamics' Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Nintendo's Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Square's Parasite Eve all push their respective systems in terms of sheer processing requirements.

Our main cover feature tackles, amongst other things, the changing tastes of consumers for the actual content of a game. Little more than a year ago, RPGs were big in Japan-but as far as Western tastes were concerned they were nothing more than fringe, enthusiast-led products, often only seeing the light of day on import. With the release of Final Fantasy VII last year, though, they have become acceptable and mainstream. After years of fighting games dominating the video game market, we are seeing the emergence of a high-profile genrea genre that is no longer stuck in the traditional swords and sorcery days of yore. Believe me, 1998 is the year of the RPG and our feature illustrates how the big games this year will mix traditional RPG fare with science fiction, horror, mysticism, action and even other more adult themes. Gaming is growing uphigh-quality storytelling is moving to the forefront of design and games are increasing in quality at an exponential rate.

Change is goodand Electronic Gaming Monthly will continue to evolve to ensure we stay on top of changes as they occur.

After a Sahara-like drought of excitement in recent months we're about to see a huge great spooge of really, really cool stuff. Not counting the fact that Nintendo has now officially confirmed the Color Game Boy (something I'm unnaturally gleeful aboutmust be the weather), we're finding that there are pant-wettingly impressive developments popping up all over the place.

Firstly, there's the fact that games on all of the existing systems are getting a much-needed shot in the arm both in terms of original ideas and technology. There are developers out there at the moment squeezing things out of the PlayStation that we really wouldn't have thought were possible a year ago. Sony's new code optimization evaluator (or whatever it's called) is allowing development teams to see exactly how far they're pushing the machine, and where there are unused scraps of processing power. Sony's own Gran Turismo was built around this-and if games were supermodels this one would be a trouser-tightening combination of all your favorites.

Future games from many developers including Crystal Dynamics, Core Design and Sony itself also make use of it, and we're going to see PlayStation games challenging the N64 in terms of graphical cleverness and fancy show-off effects. Watch out for colored lighting, hi-res 3D jiggery-pokery, particle effects (for smoke, fire and pyrotechnics) and scorching frame-rates from just about everyone in the next six months.

The N64 is starting to be pushed to its limits too. As you can see from the huge great wad of information we have on Turok 2 this month, the teams that got in on the act very early are now really learning what the machine can do. Remember all of the hype about the Project Reality and how the thing had the graphical power of a Silicon Graphics workstation in a home console? Well, after two years I think we're finally seeing what they meant. What do you know? It wasn't B.S. after all. Believe meTurok 2 is stunning and far surpasses the visual effects generated in just about any other home console game. It even does a pretty good job of putting 3D-accelerated PCs to shame.

For the future though, things are even more exciting. We've recently been lucky enough to see an extremely early version of a (hush-hush, secret-secretmake sure no one's listening) Katana game. Now, it was running on a really early development system, and was only a few percent complete but was, quite simply, astounding. For the past few years developers and industry visionaries have been spouting how the ultimate goal is to create an interactive experience with the graphical detail of Toy Story. Well, Katana may not be able to quite do thatbut it's a very big step in the right direction. We're not kidding when we tell you that this game has all the qualities of a traditional Disney cartoonbut in a full mega-mega hi-res 3D environment. And running at some ludicrous frame-rate. The characters had fully animated facial expressions and moved with the exaggerated swagger of Mickey Mouse and his min-ions.

To say it was impressive would be like saying that maybe one or two people have been to see Titanic. What's even more incredible is that what we saw was running on a very early system. We were assured by the developer that what was on show was probably less than 30 percent of what Katana can actually do. Cue sounds of jaws hitting floor and much slobbering and salivating.

108,It's Hip to Be Square,"
My sincerest apologies for making use of a Huey Lewis And The News song title to preface this, but for once a clichÃ© speaks volumes. Thank your lucky stars I'm not going to rant about the Power of Love or other such naff-rock nonsense. At last, Squaresoft has an established base in the Unied States, something that has been a long time coming After a long and healthy relationship with SCEA, we are now faced with a new company that has the creative talent of Square's U.S., Japanese and Hawaiian design studios coupled with the distribution might of Electronic Arts.

A new power in gaming has been born, and ultimately it's hardcore gamers themselves that will benefit far more than anyone else. At lastwe should see the very best that Squaresoft has to offer. Could this finally be an end to half of the really cool stuff being left behind in Japan? Let's hope so. We're very pleased to provide the first official information about the initial batch of Square games on page 122.

Much like the vast majority of information that we have this issue, our Square feature was mainly possible due to the impending games-industry Ã¼ber-show, ?3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo). Set to start just before this issue hits the shelves, Ez is the gaming equivalent of the Cannes Film Festival. Every publish-er, developer and manufacturer you can ever think of, plus many you probably can't, spend millions of dollars in a three day festival of mutual willy-waving designed to woo retailers and the press alike. This year's show is set to be particularly spectacular as some landmark events are destined to take place.

First, Sega will finally make some formal announcements about Katana. Who knows? By this time next month it may have even decided on a name for the new system. We'll certainly have some exciting news as we have already been informed that some announcements will be madewatch out for release dates, titles and a possible price.

In all, there are going to be more than 250 console games shown at E3, primarily on the PlayStation and the N64-we've spent the last month tracking down all of the confirmed announcements and our behemoth of a list acts as an introduction to this month's preview section on page 34.

The end of 1998 should prove to be a major turning point for video games. Two new systems are being announced (Katana and Color Game Boy) and a number of clear landmark products are set to go on show for the first time in the United States. While this issue acts as a huge preview for what is to come, watch out next month for a full report along with some spectacular exclusives. E3 starts on May 28, and if you can't wait to hear the news, check out our special Web site for the event, imaginatively going by the URL www.e3news.com.

109,The Future Is BrownApparently,"

You will notice a recurring theme throughout the course of this issue. Try as we might, it's difficult to ignore the impact of Ez upon the collected games industry. Three days of debauchery and whoring of video games product in a big, damp, sweaty hole called Atlanta. My apologies to any of our Georgian readers, but to a poor English chap, your weather really is akin to spending time within Satan's own armpit.

So, what did we discover? Wellwe saw Sega's Dreamcast up and running and looking decidedly impressive, and we also saw more than 300 games. Pretty impressive, I'm sure you'll agree. Unfortunately, we also seem to have discovered the games industry's latest ailment. Those of you who've been playing games for years will know that there are trends in game design. We've had the platform game fad, the fighting game phaseand now we have the 3D action game obsession. Yep, everyone had their own take on this particularly delightful fashion-and for the sake of originality, it comes in two distinct fruity flavors. First there's the cheery and cheeky 3D action camp featuring Spyro, Gex and their less credible brothers. Secondly, we have the somewhat more prolific brown camp-the dark, moody, let's show off the colored lighting set which seems to be breeding like a group of horny rabbits.

By the second day of the show, l'd already been demo'd more brown games than l'd care to see, and they were all practically the same. Cramped, badly lit, dirty-looking environments explored by a lone thug invariably viewed from behind were in evidence from nearly every major publisher. Come on! What the hell are they all playing at? Half of these games are doomed to obscurity before they've even been released. There are the guaranteed hits obviously, such as Tomb Raider 3 or Crystal's Soul Reaver, but these deserve the attention because they offer something new either conceptually or graphically. If I see another crappy 3D run-around-jumping-and-shooting game, I think I'm going to puke. I'm sure that by the holidays this year, you will feel the same.

Regardless of the volume of product though, there are a small number of games guaranteed to make an impact. We've tried to highlight these for you this month, and we'll bring you more info in future issues. Tomb 3, obviously, will make a big noise at Christmas. Beyond that though the real no brainers are Metal Gear Solid and the delightful Zelda. Beyond this there's Rare's follow-up to GoldenEye, Perfect Dark and Konami's surprise Resident Evil clone, Silent Hill. And then, something that I'm looking forward to even more than Zelda..Final Fantasy VIII-which looks stunning. These all made us squeal like girls at the show before we returned to more manly pastimes, like drinking at parties and trying to look casual when talking to girls in tight rubber costumes.

110,Time To Be A Little More Grown Up?,"

Some interesting issues have been raised in a few of this month's articles namely that of video game censorship and also women's roles in gaming history. You've probably read articles on stuff like this before, but we've tried to present both of these stories in a different light.

Your typical Girls and Gaming piece normally pontificates the noble question of which chicks are the hottestrequently highlighting the increasingly pneumatic nature of the average Lara Croft-alike's breasts. Fair enough, if there's a way of attracting a predominantly male audience, that's a sure-fire waybut there is another side you know. This month we look at how women have been involved in the development of some of the real classic games and examine why attitudes to the games themselves vary across the sexes. Women have a strong creative voice in the development community, yet are rarely acknowledged as potential gamers. Hopefully, floods of mail will ensue in time for next month. Girlsthis is your time to start yelling.

Our look into the censorship issue fits quite neatly along with this month's cover feature too. The narrow-minded musings of certain politicians seem to be garnering more support than is strictly healthy at the moment. Our News section looks at how the games industry is defending itself against a threat that all other entertainment media has tackled before. Ignorance and panic are the unfortunate reactions to things that dare to be contentious.

Metal Gear Solid is certainly a turning point in gaming in this respect. Not only is it spectacular, its content (which will no doubt be lambasted by the same ignorant politicians) is unique in the mature way that it tackles both the action and dialogue. Games have been developing in this direction for years with Final Fantasy VII and others (invariably Japanese or European titles) blazing the trail into uncharted territory. MGS is more akin to an action movie in style there's no denying that it's violent, but the subject matter and dialogue would be at home in a thriller, be it a novel or a movie. How will the self-righteous whining old wind bags react to this? In presentation we have something like a good, R-rated movie but will we have to continue to suffer the supposition that games are only played by kids? Chances are that MGS will be one of the biggest-selling games ever, proving yet again that the PlayStation is home to older gamers.

Hopefully it will prove to be a landmark product, not only in the way it defines a new genre, but also as an evangelist for video gaming acceptance.

111,The Loony Season Has Started,"
Welcome to the point in the year where everything goes completely and utterly bonkers. For the past few months everything has been ticking along nicely, and all of a sudden the gaming market wakes upand POW! there are squillions of titles on the brink of release. As you can probably tell by the somewhat weighty nature of EGM this month, we have a lot to tell you about all of a sudden. It seems the run-up to the holidays has begun, and it's only going to get more and more interesting over the next few months.

Like the movie industry, the gaming scene has its seasons and, ironically, just as the pre-Christmas movie drought starts, the torrential downpour of games begins. Our Coming Soon list has nearly 200 games on it this issueand that's just looking at products over the next three months. Sure, there are some real stinkers in there, but we have some fantastic stuff to look forward to: Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider 3, Zelda and then this month's cover star Star Wars: Rogue Squadron.

But this year's real trouser-soiling excitement factor doesn't end with what are certainly the best games on the current systems. Sega has already begun its prelaunch spooge-athon for the Dreamcast in Japan, and by the time you read this, the first details of Sonic Adventures will have hit www.videogames.com.

The new machines are very definitely on the wayDreamcast is building some serious momentum in the development community, and it would seem that the ever-reluctant-to comment Sony is also about to start shouting from the rooftops. Back at E3, SCEA representatives were adamant that nothing would be discussed concerning a replacement for the PlayStation until a year prior to the machine's launch. Wellthings have started happeningand I'd be prepared to bet large wedges of hard cash that when Dreamcast hits in Japan come November, Sony will be there saying, Well if you think that's impressivewait until you get a load of this, and then flop down something with some utterly loony specifications.

Obviously, getting a specific comment out of Sony right NOW is pretty tough going; most of our recent tries have met with the response, Hello, thank you for calling Sony Computer Entertainment of America, we're not here right nowplease leave a message after the beep. Well..something like that anyway. Rest assured though, before this Christmas we'll know something about the new PlayStation.

Soexpect some big changes again soon. The hardware will change, the games will change, maybe even the way that we play will changeand we'll make sure that EGM is providing you with all of the information you're going to need along the way.

112,Tails Is the Scrappy Doo of Gaming,"
It's nice to see an old friend back on the cover of EGM isn't it? As has been revealed on a number of occasions in recent months, he has actually been on the cover of this particular magazine more times than any other single character. He was clearly very popular in the past but we were a little concerned that despite all of his newfound flashiness and new urban look, no one cared any more. He may have enormous hands and a funny looking posture now  but does anyone actually care? We decided to throw it out to you lot and find out. After all  after the proper Sonic games back in the good old days, there have been an awful lot of crappy ones. Sonic R anyone? Sonic Jam? Sonic This? Sonic That? Sonic No Thank You We Hate You Now? There are an awful lot of reasons to argue that the little guy is no longer the slick numero uno that he used to be.

From the results we got back (which you'll see in our feature) the good looks of Sonic Adventure seem to be single-handedly raising the profile of Dreamcast. Until about a month ago everyone seemed to be adopting a wait and see attitude to the system, despite being awfully impressed by the specs. Sega would appear to have found its killer app  which is a nauseating expression adopted by far more pretentious magazines than this, so I'll refrain from using it again.

Yep. Sonic is the game everyone seems to be turned on by. You don't even appear to be turned off by the fact that Miles Tails Prower is back either. I mean  come on. Disgustingly cute, stupid-looking fluffy twin tails, corny name, big soppy eyes  yuck. He's the Scrappy Doo of the games world isn't he? No one asked for him, no one likes him, yet he turned up anyway and now we're stuck with him. Yet you still think Sonic Adventure is going to be the one and so do we.

Fortunately, from some rumors we've been picking up (and this is so last minute info that even Q-Mann didn't get a chance to write about it) we also know that the Dreamcast isn't going to be a one-trick pony. The system launch lineup will apparently include Virtua Fighter 3 with lots of extra bits and Sega Rally 2  which will be a special Dream version with lots of extras and visuals that match the Model 3 arcade machine. Beyond this we can also look forward to Yu Suzuki's first console game (which may or may not end up as an arcade machine later) and  get this  Virtua Fighter RPG. This last one is really ultra-secret, but the word on the street is that the city scene shown in really early Dreamcast demos (of which there have been a few screens released) is actually one of the towns from VFRPG.

Don't know about you, but l'm getting more and more excited about this system every day. What a shame we still have to wait nearly a year.

113,Does It Get Any Better than This?,"
The movie industry has its event movies  the Star Wars, Star Treks and Titanics and now it seems that the games industry has true event games. This month we have been lucky enough to extensively play the big two games for this holiday seasonMetal Gear Solid on the PlayStaton and Zelda on the N64. And while all this was going on, we also got some hands-on time with the next big thing over in Japannamely the first batch of Dreamcast games; including a perfect version of Virtua Fighter 3. It is indeed a good time for videogames. All of these titles are of such incredible quality that they significantly shift the proverbial goal posts within the context of our whole genre of entertainment.

Howard Lincoln has been recently (and somewhat bizarrely, if taken out of context) quoted referring to Zelda as the Gone With the Wind of gaming. It may seem like an odd simile to make, but he has a point. Zelda will probably be responsible for a significant change in fortunes for the N64. As for Metal Gear, wellwhat can we say?

It's practically the perfect entertainment experienceand not only does it put pretty much all other PlayStation titles to shame, it also has a crack at outperforming a lot of action movies in terms of both scripting and spectacle. As for the Dreamcast stuffwe'd all like arcade-perfect versions of Rally 2 and VF along with other games that all look better than most 3D-accelerated PC titles wouldn't we?

So what does this mean for us? Well, the bar has just been raised. Now more than ever there's less and less of an excuse for games to be released that are nothing more than regurgitated 3D crap. There's an awful lot of it around, and in the holiday madness ensuing at the moment you can't help but wonder at the creative justification for some of the trash that's being peddled. Check out this month's Review Crew section and you'll notice a definite line of quality. On one side there are some glorious examples of creative genius, while on the other we find yet more pathetic excuses of 3D, brown-textured rubbish with no entertainment value whatsoever. Don't get fooled by these this Christmas.

There are a number of exquisite must-buy games that will be responsible for making life better for everyone. Check them out. Just wait until next year and there'll be games appearing that push the existing systems to the limits. Developers will be trying to outdo Metal Gear's graphical splendor, Zelda's undeniably thoughtful design, while at the same time trying to convince the PlayStation and the N64 to do Dreamcast-like tricks. Remember how good SNES games got when PlayStation and Saturn were announced? Anticipate the same kind of jump in the next six months.

For the time being, things haven't often been as good as they are now. Enjoy.

114,"Happy New Year, And Stuff Like That","
This month's Slick 50 feature is something that we've been looking forward to putting together for the past few months. So often we find that things happen throughout the year where we remember (while bumbling around at 3 a.m. on deadline usually) that we pretty much saw it coming. Every now and then an announcement is made, or a game takes advantage of a certain feature that makes us all sit up and ponder how influential it's likely to be. After this happened so many times this past year we eventually decided that we really should stop just talking about it, and actually write the damn things down and tell everyone. Thus, the Slick 50 was borna list of all the things we think people are going to get excited about throughout 1999. Some of them you'll know already. Some of them you'll disagree with. And some of them are no-brainersbut we think all of them will affect our lives. Not in any deep, meaningful or earth-shattering way obviously; but definitely in a playing Zelda until your girlfriend / wife / boyfriend / husband / dog / cat / budgie leaves you in disgust kind of way. On top of that, they're pretty much all things that will help continue to push video gaming as an entertainment form that can sit alongside music and movies.

In a spectacular quirk of fate, this month's cover feature is a perfect example of some of these Slick concepts in action. Regardless of the success of the mighty South Park franchise, Iguana's creation is significant on a number of levels. Not only is it a good-looking game which will sell bucket-loads regardless of whether it's crap or not, but it's also a big step for gaming.

By adhering to the same broadcast standards as the show, Iguana has produced something that is genuinely funnybecause it doesn't hold back. And it's got farts in it. At last, the misconception that video gaming is entirely dictated by young kids is being shattered. Let's face it, if Nintendo will let the words piss, ass, bastard and m**********+ (bleeped out obviously) screamed out in a game while the player is shooting a turkey in its asshole with a gun that fires toilet plungers, then things must be moving in the right direction.

South Park will open the flood gates for adult gaming content next year. Hopefully, the more progressive developers will continue to recognize that action games can follow the same guidelines as action movies and we'll see all sorts of good stuff.

1998 has been a spectacular year for games and as we move into the new year we can rest assured that things will continue to push the boundaries both creatively and technologically. Game content is maturing, Zelda and Metal Gear are out and will change things forever, the Dreamcast is on the way and Sony is on the brink of announcing PlayStation 2. How much more good stuff could we ask for?

115,Let Us Know What You Think,"
There are some important things for you to do this monthbut the one we need you to do first is check out page 161 and sort yourself out with voting for the best games of 1998. We've even built a handy voting form on www.videogames.com (for those of you averse to writing with a pen and using envelopes and stamps and stuff)so there's no excuse for not taking a few minutes out to express yourself. We reckon the results are mostly foregone conclusions, but we're extremely keen to see what everyone thinks. If Deadly Arts or Eggs of Steel turn out to be game of the yearso be it. We'll have tangible proof that there are around half a million lunatics out therebut we'll accept that. And probably give up this games magazine stuff to grow organic vegetables in Canada or something.

Rightoff you go. Go and do it now. The rest of my monthly waffle can wait for a momentit'll still be here when you get back

See? Still here. Secondly, our reader review section is blossoming in popularityand we want to hear your views on the big games from this Christmas. There have been one hell of a lot of high profile games in stores for the past month or soand we've noticed that a few of them have failed to quite meet the expectations we all had. Let us know what you think. On a related note, you'll have noticed that a few of our reviews are a little later than you'd expect. John Ricciardi, our esteemed and oft-stressed Reviews Editor, touched on the reasons last month in his Final Word editorial, but this month we feel somewhat vindicated.

A number of the big Christmas games were clearly rushedand it's clear that we, as a community of games players, are the ones who are going to suffer because of this. Both Turok 2 and Tomb Raider 3 have been released with problems that really should have been ironed out. They're both excellent games, make no mistake, but both suffer from stupid quirks that can have a discernible effect on your enjoyment of them. I wish we could warn you of these kinds of problems sooner, and we will continue to try to do sobut I think you'll agree that our policy of only reviewing final game code is the sensible route to take. Turok 2 suffers massive slowdown, and also crashes in multiplayer..the Review Crew can tell you this. Hell, we can even tell you about the multiplayer modesthat's more than you'll read in some places.

Remember: We're on your side. If we think you're getting stiffed, we'll say so. At the end of the day, the only concern of anyone when it comes to video games is whether or not you are going to be entertained. What more could it possibly be about? Are the games fun? Is there anything that might stop you from having the very best possible experience? We'll always answer these questionsand will continue to do so.

116,Fun For Two Even Better With Four,"
By pure coincidence the two major themes of this month's issue have become inextricably intertwined. When you've put Mario on the cover, you can't help but have a good long think about what the future holds for Nintendo. As the N64 draws toward what will almost certainly be its last big year, it's more than apparent that Nintendo's tactic with the machine didn't quite work out as planned. There is no argument that the PlayStation dominates the market but it's interesting to see that the very beginning of 1999 sees the big N attacking with some renewed vigor. There are a lot of high-caliber games on the horizon and we should see a steady flow for the majority of the year.

Our other theme this month, partly inspired by the nature of Mario Party, is multiplayer gaming. This month you'll find a multiplayer strategy to Turok 2 as well as a comparison of the multiplayer aspects of Acclaim's pretty boy and the de facto experience-GoldenEye. In fact, in exploring the charms of playing multiplayer games, it has become more than apparent that the N64 really has the edge in this department. Part of it may have to do with those four holes on the front of the boxbut if you think about it, the system really is the party machine. Mario Party, Diddy Kong Racing, Mario Kart and Turok 2 are all fine examples, and the year ahead should see further fun in the shape of Mario Golf 64, Smash Brothers, Twelve Tales: Conker 64 and the incredible-looking conversion of Quake II (which we preview this month).

For many, Zelda was the single example of true excellence on the N64, but it's more than apparent that the PlayStation has a long way to come as a social system. It may be the generation-X, new-wave, Gap-wearing, swing-dancing, 20 million-selling, hip-chic machine of the majority-but the N64's final contribution to gaming as a whole may well be something social. The more people enticed to try out gaming, the betterand if the way to do that is to get them together with a six-pack, a pizza and something a bit silly with Mario in it, then that's only a good thing as far as l'm concerned.

This fact alone will no doubt be partly responsible for shaping the next generation of consoles. We already have the Dreamcastlook at the front; four holes. The QMann this month reveals the current thinking on both Nintendo's next machine and what is known so far about the PlayStation 2-but I think it's safe to say that four-player gaming straight from the box can be taken as a given.

117,Blindingly Obvious,"
This whole awards lark is always a big surprise you know. Every year its blindingly obvious that a mere handful of games are truly worthy of being commended and yet every year everyone gets whipped up into a frenzy about who's won what and why one game should beat another within a certain genre. It's great that people are so passionate about the games out thereand it's also great that we can make a big public fuss about the stuff that really deserves it.

It's also sad though that of the hundreds and hundreds of games released in 1998, only a handful were really worth considering. I don't want to piss on anyone's parade herebut nothing came even remotely close to giving Zelda or Metal Gear Solid a run for their money for Game of the Year on each respective system. We may have fought among ourselves over Best Sports Game or Best Musicbut when it came down to the nitty grittyit was pretty much a two-horse race.

On the whole, last year was a great year for gaming (and we've listed many of the reasons in our awards feature). The PlayStation became as common as, l dunno, toilet paper, the N64 boasted the best game of all time and quality and common sense prevailed as we learned GoldenEye was the biggest-selling game of the yearbut there were unfortunate trends too. For every great step forward made, there were some equally debilitating ones along the road-and I'm sad to say that it's mostly U.S. publishers and developers who are responsible.

I don't know if you noticed, but there was a distinct lack of genuine creativity in a lot of last year's games. How many snowboarding games did we have to endure? How many derivative pieces of crap were shoveled out without anyone really paying attention? How many games scored 2.0's and 3.0's from the Review Crew? How many commercially driven sequels did we have served up where the enjoyment of the gamers who play them were never really considered? It's sad that for every one of the incredible games that even got nominated for our awardsthere were hordes of others that we've all probably forgotten about already. On one hand we gave out more 10's than ever before last yearbut we also saw Crispin go scarlet with anger at the crappiness of different games more times than I'm sure is healthy.

Fortunately, the cream of the development community seems to be motivated into giving us more of the good stuff. 1999 looks set to be the glory year for the existing systemsall of the good trends from last year are already being very apparently capitalized upon and to top it off, we also get Star Wars!

Watch out next month for what is sure to be the most collectible issue of EGM ever, with details of not one, but two new Star Wars Episode One gamesand some exclusive cover art you won't ever find anywhere else. It's going to be a Star Wars spooge-athon next month. So make sure you get a copy.

118,It's a Good Month to Be in Video Games,"
It's a good month to be involved in video games. I'll admit that I often sit back and think that, but this month has been truly spectacular for two extremely significant reasons. First, and most obviously, we've been lucky enough to spend a great deal of time with not one, but two Star Wars Episode One games. I'm sure you know what a big deal that isand for many of you it's probably the reason you picked up this issue of EGM. I won't go into it any further here as we have plenty of information later in the magazineand let's face it, Star Wars is every-frickin-where at the moment. Needless to say it's all very exciting and we've got some stuff in this issue you won't see anywhere else.

Second, literally a couple of days before this issue went to print I was fortunate enough to be in Japan to see the unveiling of the Next Generation PlayStation. You can read more about it in this month's Press Start sectionbut I just wanted to impress upon you the sheer magnitude of this announcement. Sure, it's a pretty big deal to anyone who knows anything about video games but it has to be said that it is quite possibly the most important announcement in video game history.

The PlayStation is now the most successful game system ever. Sony (in a fit of frantic and deserved willy-waving at the same event) celebrated the fact that they have now sold more than 50 million systems, and the rate at which they are shifting them doesn't appear to be slowing down. The prospect of a new system has been on the horizon for some considerable time -but we are now faced with both a system and an apparent strategy that would appear to ensure Sony's dominance for at least another five years.

Not only is the new machine so incredibly powerful that it'll make your knees weak, but it is backed up by a plan that has repercussions throughout the home entertainment and technology world. Sony is going to build a chipset that puts most computers and workstations to shameand is then going to stick it in a box that will probably cost under $300. Intel and all the other manufacturers touting hi-tech wizardry must be so pissed right now..because this is going to change the way people perceive the power of computing in the home foreverand everyone's going to expect it cheap.

If you think back, no one has ever been the dominant force in gaming twice in a rowthe PlayStation has established itself as the interactive entertainment system, and along with the efforts of software companies and magazines like EGM and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine has helped push video gaming as something that isn't exclusively for teenage boys. PlayStation 2 (for want of a better name at the moment) is going to take thisand turn it into something that hopefully everyone can appreciate  in the way that everyone can appreciate a good movie and a good piece of music. If the demos of Tekken, Gran Turismo and Final Fantasy are anything to go by.I don't think they'll have too much trouble.

119,The Biggest Year Yet? And It's EGM's 10th,"
You'll notice the preview section is somewhat larger than usual this month, with a particular emphasis on really early shots in our galleries. While we're nearing what is traditionally a bit of a dead patch, it's refreshing to see there are more games than ever on the horizon. Early May just before Star Wars) will see the entire EGM staff packing its bags and spending a week in L.A. to dash excitedly around the biggest video game event of the year, the Electronic Entertainment ExpoE3. This vast display of corporate whoring is everyone's big chance to show what they have coming up before the Christmas period while trying desperately to snatch some of the limelight. Most of the games we have for you this month are very early shots of some of the games we'll be seeing then.

What's most exciting is the fact that developers seem to be taking to the Dreamcast with increased vigor. While many people seem to remain skeptical as to whether Sega will pull off the biggest turn-around of its life (see our news story this month), developers appear to be jumping on the Sega bandwagon with considerable enthusiasm. Without software, a system doesn't stand a chance, no matter how powerful it is. Dreamcast seems to be blessed with a trouser-arousing array of games, including the most impressive launch lineup we've ever seen. Chuck in the fact that it's a fighting game fan's naughty dreammultiple Capcom fighters, a Namco fighter, Virtua Fighter 3tb and Mortal Kombat Goldand it's increasingly likely that Dreamcast will have a very strong first year. Everyone has an opinion on this though, and after Shoe's little sermon last month, our boy Ricciardi has a thing or two to say this month in our Final Word column. Never before has a system caused such furious debate.

While Sega battles for respectability, the PlayStation seems unstoppable, and this year will see a number of extremely high-profile games to satisfy the 50 million+ owners who are now out there. This month's cover-game is the latest in the continuing deluge of high-profile franchise games. The original Gran Turismo was the biggest-selling PlayStation game of 1998 by a considerable margin, and it's virtually guaranteed its sequel will follow suit. We've got exclusive screens and an interview with the man behind the game.

On a more self-centered note for a moment, EGM will be celebrating its 10th anniversary next issue and as a way to signify this momentous occasion we'll be sprucing things up a bit. Expect something of a new look for us as we move into what is already turning out to be one of the most exciting years in gaming.

Oh yeahand there might be some wrestlers on the cover. Apparently they're quite popular these days.

120,It's Our10th Birthday,"
It's not often any more that I become so acutely aware of being a foreigner in these parts. As Sting would empathize, it can occasionally be difficult being an Englishman in New York (or in this case Oak Brook, Ill.). I watched, feeling more like an outsider than usual, as the U.S. media lapped up the atrocities in Littleton, Col., pointing fingers at everything they could, while having a splendid time showing video footage of Leonardo DiCaprio and scenes from Quake.

Video games are evil, we have been told. Obviously we all know they're not, but you have to acknowledge that, like it or not, the violence isn't going to go away in games any more than it is in real life. As games get more and more realistic on the new systems it will no doubt attract even more attention, just as it has in the past few years. We've explored the story in a number of areas this month, paying special attention to the ESRB ratings system in the news, something we feel people need to pay a lot more attention to.

The mainstream media, suddenly more interested in games, has been unusually keen to visit the big games expo, E3 (May 13-16), so they could point their accusatory fingers at all the nasty violence being peddled. Next month, we'll hopefully report on how the game industry is responding to the attention. There'll obviously be a huge round up of all the cool games too.

On a happier note, this issue marks the magazine's birthday, and we're very proud to unveil a new look which we hope you'll approve of. The next year or so is going to see a lot of changes in the game market, and we wanted to make sure the magazine could accommodate all the new systems, and provide you with as much information as we can find in the clearest way possible. The next few months will see some new ideas being introduced, as well as the revival of our popular How To features and enhanced hardware coverage (Get Some will be back next month too). Let us know what you thinkso we can continue to evolve the magazine for you.

121,Rare Talent,"
Every year people bemoan the fact that the summer is too quiet when it comes to game releases. Fortunately, this year is proving to be pretty exciting as we have a new system launch to look forward to in September. Check out the previews section this month and you'll see that the onslaught of Dreamcast announcements isn't letting up for one minute. We've got another 22 games for the system for you this monthand pretty much all of them look beautiful.

Elsewhere in the preview section you'll also find some in-depth coverage of the next batch of Rare games for the N64. We've been fortunate enough to get hands-on time with all the new games, but we're particularly proud of the four pages of info we have on the wonderful Perfect Dark. Crispin was recently lucky enough to chat with members of the team, and if you turn to page 8o you'll be able to see just why this could be the game of the year. It makes GoldenEye look like kid's play, and we can't wait to get our hands on it.

Outside of the previews though, who can ignore the subject of our cover feature? Resident Evil is one of the biggest franchises to develop in recent years, and our feature looks into the background of the game and gives you details of ALL the new games. Nemesis on PlayStation, RE2 on N64, Code: Veronica on Dreamcast and even the forthcoming Game Boy game. Survival horror has never been more widely available. Let's just hope the franchise doesn't get milked too much in the next couple of years though, eh?

Finally, I just want to take the very briefest of moments to say au revoir to John Ricciardi. Our erstwhile Reviews Editor has recently landed himself the position of Editor in Chief on EGM's sister strategy title, Expert Gamer. We wish him well, even if we won't have anyone to pick on any more. And before anyone asks, nohe wasn't Sushi-X.

122,The Biggest Launch in History?,"
Can you tell that we're pretty excited about the Dreamcast? After months of speculation, and a host of not terribly impressive showings in Japan, it seems that Sega of America has its act more than together for 9/9/99. There are 24 games set for day one (as we go to press) and there's hardly a duff one on the list. Having spent a lot of time with the guys at Sega, and having sent reporters out to game stores around the country we can report, with hands on hearts, that America is ready for the Dreamcastand the Dreamcast is ready for America.

Judging from the responses to our online surveys, to our Question of the Moment on the Letters page, and to the questions we posed to people in the street, there is an overwhelming feeling that this thing is going to be big. Sure, everyone has reservations because of Sega's history (32x, Sega CD) and a lot of you seem concerned that PlayStation 2 and Dolphin are going to come in and pull the carpet from underneath the DC, but one look at Soul Calibur is usually enough to make people feel better about things. The power of the system really is incredible, and after playing many of the impressive launch games, it does make going back to grainy-looking PlayStation games pretty hard for a while.

Our huge feature also covers some ground that we've not been able to talk about before, with a lot of focus on Sega's online strategy. If all goes according to plan, the Dreamcast should be significant as more than just a games machine. There's a good chance that it will change the way home users access the Internet. It's cheap, effective and fastand when you factor in some of the ideas for the huge multiplayer games due next year, Sega may well get more people onLine than Apple did when it launched the iMac.

System launches are always excitingbut this one is moreso than most. Sega is returning, and it's make or break time.

123,"Even Non Believers Like It, Apparently","
Before you plow through everything we have for you this month, I just wanted to stop for a moment and pile just a bit more praise upon the Dreamcast. It seems that with each passing month it impresses us more and more. Just recently though, it's proven itself in an area that none of us really expectedit's attracting new people to video games people who didn't normally pay any attention and dismissed it as a silly pastime.

Why? Well, from what I can gather a lot of it has to do with how beautiful all of the games look.

I was talking to a Tetris only girl (you know the typethey say they don't like games, but play their Game Boys with a fiercely competitive attitude the other day who said she had no inclination to sit in front of a TV playing PlayStation games. Once she saw Soul Calibur and even Sega Rally though, her interest was piqued enough to want to try. Why? Because they look so cool.

Dreamcast is going to (hopefully) pull new people into gaming. People who don't care whether the plays are a bit off in NFLzk, or if the alligator is facing the wrong way in Hydro Thunderthese are people who can relate to the games because they're starting to look almost real. For years everyone's been saying, You can't judge a game just by the presentation  but the DC is pulling people into games the way that special effects get butts on seats in movie theaters. It may not be good for the overall experience  but it attracts people who just want to come along for the ride.

Check out our Review section this month. We've tried to gather all of the launch games at once (although we're missing a few notably House of the Dead 2, because of the lack of a light gun) and some of them really are incredible. I defy even the staunchest Sega-hater to look at Soul Calibur and claim that there is anything wrong with it. It's starting to get to the point where you wonder just how much better things can get.

124,Why Do You Want To Catch Em All?,"
You've spent $5 billion on PokÃ©mon stuff in the last two years. That's nine zeroesand considerably more money than most forms of entertainment ever stand a chance of making in their entire lifetime. It's more than Star Wars, considerably more than Titanic and certainly a lot more than your average Game Boy game.

In researching this month's cover feature we found that there are 90 companies in the U.S. producing PokÃ©mon merchandisethere are 4.2 million Americans out there playing the thingand the average PokÃ©maniac really is completely flipped out on the stuff. We saw kids at airports go loopy when they saw the ANA plane with the art on the side, we saw families at Disney World (ironically) completely decked out in PokÃ©mon gear-from backpacks to shoes to sunglasses and hats. Remember years ago when it was proclaimed that kids recognized Mario more than Mickey Mouse? Looks like neither of them stand a chance when it comes to Pikachu.

The TV show has gone from cult status at a weird time to be the WB's biggest ratings success, running six times a week. The movie looks set to break all kinds of box-office records and the games continue to hold on to the top two spots in the charts-every month.

PokÃ©mon is proof that video games are the biggest, baddest, fastest growing form of entertainment in the world, and Nintendo has tapped into the very heart of the average kid's psyche with this thing. It's going to get wilder too. If you check out our feature you'll be able to see the first details about the new games set for release later this year in Japan. New games that introduce hundreds more PokÃ©mon into the simple game universe-and at the same time introducing hundreds and hundreds of merchandising opportunities.

The Game Boy10 years old, the simplest hardware on the market-and at the heart of one of the biggest entertainment phenomena in history. How cool is that?

125,Big Hairy Monkeys for $70,"
Nintendo has big plans for Donkey Kong 64. Clearly hoping to repeat the magic that Rare's Donkey Kong Country performed for the SNES, it comes at a vitally important time for the N64. Is it really the game that will save Christmas for Nintendo? Is everyone going to swallow that hefty $70 price tag? Are people going to be pissed that you can only buy it bundled with an Expansion Pak, even if you've already got one? Is it going to be a good gameor is it a repackaged Banjo-Kazooie wannabe designed to cash in on an age-old franchise? We take a long hard look at what many think will be the biggest game since Zelda, and the game that's replaced Perfect Dark as the biggie' for Nintendo this Christmas.

Personally, I was a little bit disappointed with it. How many frickin' cuddly character-based 3D adventure games do we actually need on the N64? Mario was amazing, Banjo was cool, but at first glance DK64 doesn't raise the bar to anywhere near the degree that these two did. I have no doubts that it's a wonderful game with hours and hours of gameplaybut couple the lack of innovation with that huge price tag, and I think it could cause something of a backlash.

Still, come Thanksgiving, I'm sure we'll all be reading reports of how it's the fastest-selling game ever. When (or if) you buy itmake sure you send us a review. This is your magazinewe want to know what you think.
